        9.12) contains measurements of phosphate and chloride in the urine of
        12 men with similar weights. Observation 3, which has the lowest
        phosphate value, stands out clearly from the rest. However the normal
        Q-Q plot of phosphate, does not reveal any atypical value, and the same
        occurs in the Q-Q plot of chloride. Thus the atypical character of
        observation 3 is visible only when considering both variables
        simultaneously. The omission of this observation has no important
        effect on means or variances, but the correlation almost doubles in
        magnitude, i.e., the influence of the outlier has been to decrease the
        correlation by a factor of two relative to that without the outlier.
