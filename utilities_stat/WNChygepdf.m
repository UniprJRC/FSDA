function Wpdf = WNChygepdf(X,N,K,M,W)
%WNChygepdf returns Wallenius' non-central hypergeometric probability density values.

%
% This function is taken from the toolbox "Generation of Random Variates"
% (function wallen_pdf.m) created by Jim Huntley, that can be found at the
% Mathworks page:
% https://it.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/35008-generation-of-random-variates).
% FSDA uses the function only to demonstrate the coherence of the non-central
% hypergeometric distribution probability density values with samples extracted
% with FSDA function randsampleFS using option for weighted sampling without
% replacement.
%
% To illustrate the meaning of Wallenius' function parameters, let's use
% the classical urn example, with $m_{1}$ red balls and  $m_{2}$ white balls,
% totalling $M = m_{1}+m_{2}$ balls. $N$ balls are drawn at random from the urn
% one by one without replacement. Each red ball has the weight $\omega_{1}$, and
% each white ball has the weight $\omega_{2}$; the probability ratio of red over
% white balls is then given by $W = \omega_{1} / \omega_{2}$.
%
%  Required input arguments:
%           X    : Number of red balls sampled. Scalar.
%                  Data Types - single|double
%           N    : Total number of balls sampled. Scalar.
%                  Data Types - single|double
%           K    : Initial number of red balls in the urn. Scalar.
%                  Data Types - single|double
%           M    : Total number of balls in urn before sampling. Scalar.
%                  Data Types - single|double
%           W    : Probability ratio of red over white balls. Scalar.
%                  Data Types - single|double
%
%  Optional input arguments:
%
%  Output:
%
%           Wpdf : Wallenius' pdf values. Probability of drawing exactly X of a
%                  possible K items in N drawings without replacement from a
%                  group of M objects, when objects are from two weighted groups.
%                  Array of numel(x) values.
%                  Data Types - single|double.

    % Problem description.
    %we have 500 balls in the urn
    M  = 500;   
    %we extract 3 balls, one at a time, without replacement

    K  = M/2;   
    %red balls are ten times the white balls

    % We compute the probability of getting 0, 1, 2 or 3 red balls in drawing
    % 3 balls without replacement.
