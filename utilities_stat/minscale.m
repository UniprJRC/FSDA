function sc = minscale(u, c, kc, initialsc, tol, maxiter)
%minscale finds the M estimator of the scale for TB
%
%  REMARK: THIS FUNCTION HAS BEEN REPLACED BY Mscale because minscale just
%  refers to Tukey's biweight At present this routine is just called by
%  Smult and MMmult or MMmultcore
%
% u = residuals or Mahalanobis distances 
% (note that u is kept fixed in each iteration)
% Remark: the scale must satisfy the following equation
% $(1/n) \sum_{i=1}^n \rho((u_i/c)/s) = kc$
% This routine computes the minimum value of s which satisfies the above
% equation%
%
%
%
% Required input arguments:
%
%    u:       : n x 1 vector which contains the residuals 
%    c        : scalar, tuning constant of the equation for Tukey biweight
%   kc        : kc= E(\rho) scalar, tuning constant linked to Tukey's biweight
%               E(\rho) = bdp* \rho(c)
%               For Tukey's biweight \rho(c) = (c^2/6) therefore 
%               E(\rho) = bdp* c^2/6
%
%  Optional input arguments:
%
%    initialsc: scalar. The initial estimate of the scale.
%               If not defined, scaled MAD of vector |u| is used.
%     maxiter : scalar. The maximum number of iterations to find the scale.
%               If not defined, maxiter is fixed to 200.
%     tol     : scalar. The tolerance for controlling convergence.
%               If not defined, tol is fixed to 1e-7.
%
%  Output:
%
%  sc : scalar, minimum value of the scale
%
% Remark: this routine is called by Smult.m
