%RandIndexFS calculates Rand type Indices to compare two partitions
%
%<a href="matlab: docsearchFS('RandIndexFS')">Link to the help function</a>
%
% Suppose we want to compare two partitions summarized by the contingency
% table $T=[n_{ij}]$ where $i=1, 2, ..., r$ and $j=1,...,c$ and $n_{ij}$
% denotes the number of data points which are in cluster i in the first
% partition and in cluster j in the second partition. Let A denote the
% number of all pairs of data points which are either put into the same
% cluster by both partitions or put into different clusters by both
% partitions. Conversely, let D denote the number of all pairs of data
% points that are put into one cluster in one partition, but into different
% clusters by the other partition. The partitions disagree for all pairs D
% and agree for all pairs A. A+D=totcomp= total number of comparisons.
% We can measure the agreement by the Rand index A/(A+D)=A/(totcomp) which
% is invariant with respect to permutations of the columns or rows of T.
% The index has to be corrected for agreement by chance if the sizes of the
% clusters are not uniform (which is usually the case). Since the Rand
% index lies between 0 and 1, the expected value of the Rand index
% (although not a constant value) must be greater than or equal to 0. On
% the other hand, the expected value of the adjusted Rand index has value
% zero and the maximum value of the adjusted Rand index is also 1. Hence,
% there is a wider range of values that the adjusted Rand index can take
% on, thus increasing the sensitivity of the index. The formula of the
% adjusted Rand index (AR) is given below
% \[
%  AR= \frac{\mbox{RI- Expected value of RI}}{\mbox{Max Index  - Expected value of RI}}
% \]

%
% Required input arguments:
%
%    c1:   labels of first partition or contingency table. A numeric or
%          character vector containining the class labels of
%          the first partition or a 2-dimensional numeric matrix which
%          contains the cross-tabulation of cluster assignments.
%          Data Types: single | double | char | logical
%    c2:   labels of second partition. A numeric or character vector
%          containining the class labels of
%          the second partition. The length of vector c2 must be equal to
%          the length of vector c1. This second input is required just if
%          c1 is not a 2-dimensional numeric matrix.
%          Data Types: single | double | char | logical
%
%
%Optional input arguments:
%
%   noisecluster: label or number associated to the 'noise class' or 'noise level'.

%
% Output:
%
%  AR:          Adjusted Rand index. Scalar. A number between -1 and 1.
%               The adjusted Rand index is the corrected-for-chance version
%               of the Rand index.
%  RI:          Rand index (unadjusted). Scalar. A number between 0 and 1.
%               Rand index computes the fraction of pairs of objects for
%               which both classification methods agree.
%               RI ranges from 0 (no pair classified in the same way under
%               both clusterings) to 1 (identical clusterings).
%  MI:          Mirkin's index. Scalar. A number between 0 and 1.
%               Mirkin's index computes the percentage of pairs of objects for
%               which both classification methods disagree. MI=1-RI.
%  HI :         Hubert index. Scalar.  A number between -1 and 1.
%               HI index is equal to the fraction of pairs of objects for
%               which both classification methods agree minus the
%               fraction of pairs of objects for which both
%               classification methods disagree. HI= RI-MI.
