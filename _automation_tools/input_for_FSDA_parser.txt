TEMPLATE FOR PARSER


------------------------------------------------------------------------
REMARK: if symbol % is wanted and it is not a simple comment delimiter it must be replaced by words "per cent". For example, string "50% envelope" must become "50 per cent" envelope.

---------------------------------------------------

[out1,out2]=FSRB(y,X,varargin)


If there is just one output argument it can be without square brackets

y,X,varargin spaces after commas are not important 
y, X   ,  varargin   is fine too

----------------------
string

% Required input arguments:


must be present

---------------------------
string

% Optional input arguments:


must be present even if there are no optional arguments
--------------


Optional input args must be those which have "%" then "a series of spaces" then "a word" then "a series of spaces" then ":"

For example 

%   intercept   :  Indicator for constant

IMPORTANT for every other string never use  a structure like "anyword  :" because parser thinks that anyword is an optional input argument

The only one exception is the word REMARK : 

The last two rows of every optional input argument must contain
%                     Example - 'init',100
%                     Data Types - double


If there is a remark, it must be put at the very end of the description 
of the optional input argument. At the very end means after the rows Example and Data Types

For instance see the eaxmple below
%              REMARK: if structure bayes is not supplied the default
%                      values which are used are
%                      beta0= zeros(p,1)  % vector of zeros
%                      R=eye(p);          % Identity matrix
%                      tau0=1/1e+6;       % Very large value for the
%                                         % prior variance, that is a very
%                                         % small value for tau0
%                      n0=1;              % just one prior observation
%                     Example - bayes=struct;bayes.R=R;bayes.n0=n0;bayes.beta0=beta0;bayes.tau0=tau0;
%                     Data Types - double
--------------------------------------------


What is afer the word example  does not have to contain spaces 

----------------------------------------------------- 
What is before the first full stop of the optional input args is the description
What is before the second full stop of the optional input args is the data type
What is before the third  full stop of the optional input args is the long description 

For example


%   plots:      Plot on the screen. Scalar. 
%               If plots=1 the added variable
%               plot is produced else (default) no plot is produced.
%               Example - 'plots',1 
%               Data Types - double

------------
string 

% Output:

must be present

What is in the first sentence (nefore first stop) is assumed to be the title of the output argument.
-------------------------

If some elements of the output arguments are structures their field name must be preceed by the name of the structure and then the description must be preceed by = symbol (NOT by symbol ":"  )

REMEMBER THAT THE FIELDS of an output instance HAVE TO CONTAIN THE = SIGN AND NOT THE : SIGN

For instance

%  The output consists of a structure 'out' containing the following fields:
% out.ListOut=  k x 1 vector containing the list of the units declared as
%               outliers or NaN if the sample is homogeneous
% out.mdrB    =  (n-init) x 2 matrix
%               1st col = fwd search index
%               2nd col = value of Bayesian minimum deletion residual in
