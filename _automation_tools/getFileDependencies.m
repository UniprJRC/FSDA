function list =  getFileDependencies(file)
% searches the paths of the .m-Files the given file is using. This function
% depends on the depfun-Function of Matlab. Though it is not guaranteed,
% that all files will be found. E.g. files in evaluate-constructs won't be
% found!!
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%
% Parameters:
%     - file: the file for which the dependencies should be searched. This
%             could be only a string with the function-name, the filename
%             or the path to a file.
%
% Returns:
%     - list: a cell-Array with the paths to all files the given file uses
%             as strings. list is -1 if an error occured while processing.
%             See errormessage for details.
