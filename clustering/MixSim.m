%
%  Optional input arguments:
%
%    BarOmega : Requested average overlap. Scalar. Value of desired average
%               overlap. The default value is ''

%               $p_{ij}$, is defined as the sum of the two misclassification
%               probabilities
%               $p_ij=w_{j|i} + w_{i|j}$
%               Remark2- it is possible to specify up to two values among
%               BarOmega MaxOmega and StdOmega.
%               Example - 'StdOmega',0.05
%               Data Types - double
%
%         sph : Spherical covariances. Scalar logical or structure.
%               Scalar boolean or structure which specifies covariance
%               matrix. When sph is logical value, if:
%               sph=false (default) ==> non-spherical clusters;
%               sph=true            ==> spherical clusters= const*I.
%               The following options "hom", "ecc" and "restrfactor" have
%               an effect just if sph is a scalar boolean. The default
%               value of sph is false that is non spherical clusters are
%               generated.
%               If sph is a structure it may contain the following fields.
%               sph.pars = a 3 letter character in the set:
%               'VVE','EVE','VVV','EVV','VEE','EEE','VEV','EEV','VVI',
%               'EVI','VEI','EEI','VII','EII' which
%               specifies the type of Gaussian Parsimonious Clustering
%               Model which nedds to be generated. Note that this field is
%               compulsory.
%               sph.cdet = scalar which specifies the restriction factor
%                          for determinants across groups. If this field is
%                          empty or if this field is missing no contraint
%                          is imposed among determinants.
%               sph.shw = scalar which specifies the restriction factor for
%                         shape matrices within each group. If this field is
%                          empty or if this field is missing, no contraint
%                          is imposed among the elements of each shape
%                          matrix of a particular group.
%               sph.shb = scalar which specifies the restriction factor for
%                         shape matrices between each group. If this field is
%                          empty or if this field is missing, no contraint
%                          is imposed across the elements of each shape
%                          matrix between the groups.
%               Example - 'sph',false
%               Data Types - boolean
%
%         hom : Equal Sigmas. Scalar logical.
%               Scalar boolean which specifies heterogeneous or homogeneous
%               clusters. This option has an effect just if previous option
%               sph is a scalar boolean.
%               hom=false (default) ==> heterogeneous;
%               hom=true            ==> homogeneous $\Sigma_1 = ... =
%               \Sigma_k$
%               Example - 'hom',false
%               Data Types - boolean
%
%         ecc : maximum eccentricity. Scalar.
%               Scalar in the interval (0, 1] which defines maximum eccentricity.
%               For example, if ecc=0.9 (default value), we require for
%               each group that sqrt(1 - minL / maxL) <= 0.9 where minL and
%               maxL are respectively the min and max eigenvalue of the cov
%               matrix of a particular group. This option has an effect
%               just if previous option sph is a scalar boolean.
%               Example - 'ecc',0.8
%               Data Types - double
%
%  restrfactor: eigenvalue restriction factor. Scalar.
%               Scalar in the interval [1 \infty] which specifies the
%               maximum ratio to allow between the largest eigenvalue and
%               the smallest eigenvalue of the k covariance matrices which
%               are generated. The default value is ''. More in details if
%               for example restrfactor=10 after generating the covariance
%               matrices we
%               check that the ratio
%               \[
%                 \frac{   \max_{l=1, \ldots, v} \max_{j=1, \ldots, k}  \lambda_l(\hat \Sigma_j)}{   \min_{l=1, \ldots, v} \min_{j=1, \ldots, k}  \lambda_l(\hat \Sigma_j)}.
%               \]
%               between the largest eigenvalue of the k cov matrices
%               and the smallest eigenvalue of the k cov matrices is not
%               larger than restrfactor. In order to apply this restriction
%               (which is typical of tclust.m) we call routine
%               restreigen.m.
%               This option has an effect just if previous option sph is a
%               scalar boolean.

%               Data Types - double
%
%       PiLow : Smallest mixing proportion. Scalar.
%               Value of the smallest mixing proportion (if 'PiLow'
%               is not reachable with respect to k, equal proportions are
%               taken; PiLow = 1.0 implies equal proportions by default).
%               PiLow must be a number in the interval (0 1]. Default value
%               0.

%               misclassification probabilities (default is 1e-06)
%               tol(2) (which will be called tolnxc2) specifies the

%               of linear combinations of non central chi2 distributions).
%               The default value of tol(2) 1e-06.

%
%  More About:
%
%  MixSim(k,v) generates k groups in v dimensions. It is possible to
%  control the average and maximum or standard deviation of overlapping.
%
%  Given two generic clusters $i$ and $j$ with $i \ne j =1, ..., k$,
%  indexed by $\phi(x; \mu_i,\Sigma_i)$ and $\phi(x; \mu_j,\Sigma_j)$ with
%  probabilities of occurrence $\pi_i$ and $\pi_j$, the misclassification
%  probability with respect to cluster $i$ (that is conditionally on $x$
%  belonging to cluster $i$,  which is called  $w_{j|i}$) is defined as
%  $Pr[ \pi_i \phi(x;\mu_i,\Sigma_i) < \pi_j \phi(x;\mu_j,\Sigma_j)]$.
%  The matrix containing the misclassification probabilities $w_{j|i}$ is
%  called OmegaMap
%  The probability of overlapping between groups $i$ and $j$ is given by:
%  \[
%            w_{j|i} + w_{i|j}    \qquad      i,j=1,2, ..., k
%  \]
%  The diagonal elements of OmegaMap are equal to 1.
%  The average overlap (which in the code is called below BarOmega) is
%  defined as the sum of the off diagonal elements of OmegaMap (matrix of
%  misclassification probabilities) divided by 0.5*k*(k-1)
%  The maximum overlap (which in the code is called MaxOmega) is defined as
%  $\max(w_{j|i} + w_{i|j}$),  $i \ne j=1,2, ..., k$.
%  The probability of misclassification $w_{j|i}$ is nothing but the cdf of a linear
%  combination of non central $\chi^2$ distributions with 1 degree of freedom
%  + a linear combination of $N(0,1)$ evaluated in a
%  point c.  The coefficients of the linear combinations of non central
%  $\chi^2$ and $N(0,1)$ depend on the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of matrix
%  $\Sigma_{j|i} = \Sigma^{0.5}_i \Sigma^{-1}_j \Sigma^{0.5}_i$.
%  Point $c$ depends on the same eigenvalues and eigenvectors
%  of matrix $\Sigma_{j|i}$, the mixing proportions $\pi_i$ and $\pi_j$ and the
%  determinants $|\Sigma_i|$ and $|\Sigma_j|$.
%  This probability is computed using routine ncx2mixtcdf.m
