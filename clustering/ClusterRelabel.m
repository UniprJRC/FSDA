%  Required input arguments:
%
%         IDX   : Assignment of units to groups for different values of c
%                   (restriction factor) and k (number of groups). Cell.
%                   Cell of size length(kk)-times length(cc), where kk is
%                   the vector which contains the number of groups which
%                   have been considered and cc is the vector which
%                   contains the values of the restriction factor.  Each
%                   element of the cell is a vector of length n containing
%                   the assignment number of each unit using a particular
%                   classification model.
%                 Data Types -  cell
%
%   pivotunits :  list of the units which must (whenever possible)
%                   have the same label. Numeric vector.  For example if
%                   pivotunits=[20 26], means that group which contains
%                   unit 20 is always labelled with number 1. Similarly,
%                   the group which contains unit 26 is always labelled
%                   with number 2, (unless it is found that unit 26 already
%                   belongs to group 1). In general, group which contains
%                   unit UnitsSameGroup(r) where r=2, ...length(kk)-1 is
%                   labelled with number r (unless it is found that unit
%                   UnitsSameGroup(r) has already been assigned to groups
%                   1, 2, ..., r-1).
%                 Data Types -  integer vector
%
%  Optional input arguments:
%
%
%
%  Output:
%
%   IDXrelabelled  : cell with the same size as input cell IDX and with
%                   the same meaning of input cell IDX but with consistent
%                   labels. Cell. Group which contains unit
%                   UnitsSameGroup(1)  is labelled with number 1. In
%                   general. Group which contains UnitsSameGroup(r) where
%                   r=2, ...length(kk)-1 is labelled with number r (unless
%                   it is found that unit UnitsSameGroup(r) has already
%                   been assigned to groups 1, 2, ..., r-1).
%
%   idxMapping   : indexes of the permutations associated with IDX{1,1}. 
%                       r-by-2 matrix. 
%                       Matrix of size r-by-2 which keeps track of all the
%                       permutations which have been done. For example if 
%                       idxMapping is equal to  [3, 1; 3, 2],
%                       it means that in the first iteration labels 1 and 3
%                       have swapped, while in the second iteration label 3
%                       and 2 have swapped. If no swapping was necessary
%                       idxMapping is empty.

    % A small number of subsamples just to show whow the procedure works.
    nsamp=10;

    % Make sure that units [23 54] are whenever possible respectively in

    UnitsSameGroup=[23 54];

    % In this case OldNewIndexes is equal to
