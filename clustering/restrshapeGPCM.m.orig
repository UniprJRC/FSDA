%
% The purpose of this routine is to produce the constrained shape matrix
% $\Gamma$.
% This routine copes with the second of the 3 letters of modeltype. It
% deals with the cases in which the second letter is E, or I or V. If the
% second letter is V procedure restrshapecore is invoked and both (within
% groups) cshw, and (between groups) cshb constraints are imposed. If the
% second letter of modeltype is E just cshw is used. If the second letter
% is I, GAMc becomes a matrix of ones.
%
%
% Required input arguments:
%
%     lmd : Determinants. Vector.
%            Row vector of length k containing in the j-th position
%           $|\Sigma_j|^(1/p)$, $j=1, 2, \ldots, k$ if different
%           determinants are allowed else it is a row vector of ones.

%           position (:,:,j) the rotation

%   SigmaB : initial unconstrained covariance matrices. p-by-p-by-k array.
%            p-by-p-by-k array containing the k unconstrained covariance
%            matrices for the k groups.
%   niini  : size of the groups. Vector.
%           Row vector of length k containing the size of the groups.
%     pa : constraining parameters. Structure. Structure containing 3 letter character specifying modeltype,

%            pa.k = scalar, number of groups.
%            pa.pars = type of Gaussian Parsimonious Clustering Model.
%               A 3 letter word in the set:

%               'EVI','VEI','EEI','VII','EII'

%            varying shape matrices.

%
%  Optional input arguments:
%
%
% Output:
%
%     GAMc : constrained shape matrix. Matrix of size p-by-k containing in
%           column j the elements on the main diagonal of shape matrix
%           $\Gamma_j$. The elements of GAMc satisfy the following
%           constraints:
%           The product of the elements of each column is equal to 1.
%           The ratio among the largest elements of each column is
%           not greater than pa.shb.

%           The ratio of the elements of each column is not greater than
%           pa.shw.
%           All the columns of matrix GAMc are equal if the second
%           letter of modeltype is E. All the columns of matrix GAMc are
%           equal to 1 if the second letter of modeltype is I. This matrix
