%
%  Required input arguments:
%
%  k  : number of components (groups). Integer. Scalar associated to the
%       number of groups
%               Data Types - int16|int32|int64|single|double
%  v  : dimensionality (number of variables). Integer. Scalar associated to the
%       number of variables of the data matrix.
%               Data Types - int16|int32|int64|single|double
%  Pi : Mixing proportions. Vector. Vector of size k containing mixing
%       proportions. The sum of the elements of Pi is 1. 
%  Mu : centroids. Matrix. Matrix of size k-by-v containing (in the rows) the centroids of the
%       k groups. 
%  S  : Covariance matrices. 3D array. 3D array of size v-by-v-by-k
%       containing covariance matrices of the
%       k groups. 
%
%  Optional input arguments:
%
%  tol : tolerance. Scalar. Default is 1e-06.
%               Optional parameters tol and lim will be used by
%               function ncx2mixtcdf.m which computes the cdf of a linear
%               combination of non central chi2 r.v.. This is the
%               probability of misclassification.
%               Example - 'tol', 0.0001
%               Data Types - double
%
%  lim : maximum number of integration terms. Scalar. Default is 1000000.
%               Optional parameters tol and lim will be used by
%               function ncx2mixtcdf.m which computes the cdf of a linear
%               combination of non central chi2 r.v.. This is the
%               probability of misclassification.
%               Example - 'lim', 1000
%               Data Types - double
%
% Output:
%
%    OmegaMap : map of misclassification probabilities. Matrix. k-by-k matrix containing map of misclassification
%               probabilities. More precisely, OmegaMap(i,j)
%               $(i ~= j)=1, 2, ..., k$
%               $OmegaMap(i,j) = w_{j|i}$ is the probability that X
%               coming from the i-th component (group) is classified
%               to the $j-th$ component.
%               The probability of overlapping (called pij) between groups
%               i and j is given by
%                  $pij=pji= w_j|i + w_i|j    \qquad      i,j=1,2, ..., k$.
%    BarOmega : Average overlap. Scalar. Scalar associated with average overlap. BarOmega is computed as
%               sum(sum(OmegaMap))-k)/(0.5*k(k-1).
%    MaxOmega : Maximum overlap. Scalar. Scalar associated with maximum overlap. MaxOmega is the
%               maximum of OmegaMap(i,j)+OmegaMap(j,i)
%               (i ~= j)=1, 2, ..., k.
%    StdOmega : Std of overlap. Scalar. Scalar assocaited with standard deviation of overlap (that
%               is the standard deviation of the 0.5*k(k-1) pij
%               (probabilities of overlapping)
%       rcMax : pair with largest overlap. Vector. Column vector of length equal to 2 containing the indexes
%               associated with the pair of components producing the
%               highest overlap (largest off diagonal element of matrix
%               OmegaMap)
