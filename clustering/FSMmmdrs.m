function out=FSMmmdrs(Y,varargin)
%FSMmmdrs performs random start monitoring of minimum Mahalanobis distance
%
%<a href="matlab: docsearchFS('FSMmmdrs')">Link to the help function</a>
%
% The trajectories originate from many different random initial subsets and
% provide information on the presence of groups in the data. Groups
% are investigated by monitoring the minimum Mahalanobis
% distance outside the FS subset.
%
% Required input arguments:
%
% Y :           Input data. Matrix.
%               n x v data matrix; n observations and v variables. Rows of
%               Y represent observations, and columns represent variables.
%               Missing values (NaN's) and infinite values (Inf's) are
%               allowed, since observations (rows) with missing or infinite
%               values will automatically be excluded from the
%               computations.
%                Data Types - single|double
%
%
% Optional input arguments:
%
%       init :  scalar, specifies the point where to initialize the search
%               and start monitoring the required diagnostics. If not
%               specified, it is set equal to p+1.
%                 Example - 'init',10
%                 Data Types - double
%
%   bsbsteps :  vector which specifies for which steps of the fwd search it
%               is necessary to save the units forming subset for each
%               random start. If bsbsteps is 0 for each random start we
%               store the units forming subset in all steps. The default is
%               store the units forming subset in all steps if n<=500 else
%               to store the units forming subset at step init and steps
%               which are multiple of 100. For example, if n=753 and
%               init=6, units forming subset are stored for m=init, 100,
%               200, 300, 400, 500 and 600.
%                 Example - 'bsbsteps',[10 20 30]
%                 Data Types - double
%               REMARK: vector bsbsteps must contain numbers from init to
%               n. if min(bsbsteps)<init a warning message will appear on
%               the screen.
%
%     nsimul :  scalar, number of random starts. Default value=200.
%                 Example - 'nsimul',1000
%                 Data Types - double
%
%   nocheck  : It controls whether to perform checks on matrix Y. Scalar.
%                 If nocheck is equal to 1 no check is performed.
%                 As default nocheck=0.
%                 Example - 'nocheck',1
%                 Data Types - double
%
%      plots :  scalar. If equal to one a plot of random starts minimum
%               Mahalanobis residual appears  on the screen with 1%, 50% and
%               99% confidence bands else (default) no plot is shown. 
%               The scale (ylim) for the y axis is defined as follows:
%               ylim(2) is the maximum between the values of mmd in steps
%               [n*0.2 n] and the final value of the 99 per cent envelope
%               multiplied by 1.1. 
%               ylim(1) is the minimum between the
%               values of mmd in steps [n*0.2 n] and the 1 per cent
%               envelope multiplied by 0.9.
%               Example - 'plots',0
%               Data Types - double
%               Remark: the plot which is produced is very simple. In order
%               to control a series of options in this plot (including the
%               y scale) and in order to connect it dynamically to the
%               other forward plots it is necessary to use function
%               mmdrsplot.
%
%   numpool :  scalar. If numpool > 1, the routine automatically checks
%               if the Parallel Computing Toolbox is installed and
%               distributes the random starts over numpool parallel
%               processes. If numpool <= 1, the random starts are run
%               sequentially. By default, numpool is set equal to the
%               number of physical cores available in the CPU (this choice
%               may be inconvenient if other applications are running
%               concurrently). The same happens if the numpool value
%               chosen by the user exceeds the available number of cores.
%               Example - 'numpool',8
%               Data Types - double
%               REMARK : up to R2013b, there was a limitation on the
%               maximum number of cores that could be addressed by the
%               parallel processing toolbox (8 and, more recently, 12).
%               From R2014a, it is possible to run a local cluster of more
%               than 12 workers.
%               REMARK : Unless you adjust the cluster profile, the
%               default maximum number of workers is the same as the
%               number of computational (physical) cores on the machine.
%               REMARK : In modern computers the number of logical cores
%               is larger than the number of physical cores. By default,
%               MATLAB is not using all logical cores because, normally,
%               hyper-threading is enabled and some cores are reserved to
%               this feature.
%               REMARK : It is because of Remarks 3 that we have chosen as
%               default value for numpool the number of physical cores
%               rather than the number of logical ones. The user can
%               increase the number of parallel pool workers allocated to
%               the multiple start monitoring by:
%               - setting the NumWorkers option in the local cluster profile
%                 settings to the number of logical cores (Remark 2). To do
%                 so go on the menu "Home|Parallel|Manage Cluster Profile"
%                 and set the desired "Number of workers to start on your
%                 local machine".
%               - setting numpool to the desired number of workers;
%               Therefore, *if a parallel pool is not already open*,
%               UserOption numpool (if set) overwrites the number of
%               workers set in the local/current profile. Similarly, the
%               number of workers in the local/current profile overwrites
%               default value of 'numpool' obtained as feature('numCores')
%               (i.e. the number of physical cores).
%
%  cleanpool :  Boolean. Cleanpool is 1 (true) if the parallel pool has to be cleaned after
%               the execution of the random starts. Otherwise it is 0 (false).
%               The default value of cleanpool is false.
%               Clearly this option has an effect just if previous option
%               numpool is > 1.
%               Example - 'cleanpool',1
%               Data Types - boolean
%
%       msg  :  Level of output to display. Scalar. Scalar which controls whether to display or not messages
%               about random start progress. More precisely, if previous
%               option numpool>1, then a progress bar is displayed, on
%               the other hand a message will be displayed on the screen
%               when 10%, 25%, 50%, 75% and 90% of the random starts have
%               been accomplished
%                 Example - 'msg',0
%                 Data Types - double
%               REMARK: in order to create the progress bar when nparpool>1
%               the program writes on a temporary .txt file in the folder
%               where the user is working. Therefore it is necessary to
%               work in a folder where the user has write permission. If this
%               is not the case and the user (say) is working without write
%               permission in folder C:\Program Files\MATLAB the following
%               message will appear on the screen:
%                   Error using ProgressBar (line 57)
%                   Do you have write permissions for C:\Program Files\MATLAB?
%
%  Remark:      The user should only give the input arguments that have to
%               change their default value. The name of the input arguments
%               needs to be followed by their value. The order of the input
%               arguments is of no importance.
%
%               The dataset can include missing values (NaN's) and infinite
%               values (Inf's), since observations (rows) with missing or
%               infinite values will be automatically excluded from the
%               computations. y can be both a row of column vector.
%
%
% Output:
%
%
%  out :     A structure containing the following fields:
%       out.mmdrs=  Minimum Mahalanobis distance. Matrix.
%               (n-init)-by-(nsimul+1) matrix which contains the monitoring
%               of minimum Mahalanobis distance at each step of the forward
%               search for each random start.
%               1st col = fwd search index (from init to n-1);
%               2nd col = minimum Mahalanobis distance for random start 1;
%               ...;
%               nsimul+1 col = minimum deletion residual for random start nsimul.
%
%       out.BBrs= units belonging to the subset. 3D array.
%               Units belonging to the subset
%               at the steps specified by input option bsbsteps.
%               If bsbsteps=0 BBrs has size n-by-(n-init+1)-by-nsimul.
%               In this case BBrs(:,:,j) with j=1, 2, ..., nsimul
%               has the following structure:
%               1-st row has number 1 in correspondence of the steps in
%                   which unit 1 is included inside subset and a missing
%                   value for the other steps;
%               ......
%               (n-1)-th row has number n-1 in correspondence of the steps
%                   in which unit n-1 is included inside subset and a
%                   missing value for the other steps;
%               n-th row has the number n in correspondence of the steps in
%                   which unit n is included inside subset and a missing
%                   value for the other steps.
%               If, on the other hand, bsbsteps is a vector which specifies
%               the steps of the search in which it is necessary to store
%               subset, BBrs has size n-by-length(bsbsteps)-by-nsimul.
%               In other words, BBrs(:,:,j) with j=1, 2, ..., nsimul has
%               the same structure as before, but now contains just
%               length(bsbsteps) columns.
%       out.Y = original n-by-v input datamatrix.

    % Two groups (different sizes).
    % Same example as before but now there is one group which has a size
    % much greater than the other (n1=60 and n2=150). In this case it is
    % possible to see that there is a trajectory of minimum Mahalanobis
    % residual which goes outside the envelope in steps 60-80. This
    % corresponds to the searches initialized using the units coming from
    % the smaller group. Note that due to the partial overlapping after the
    % peak in steps 80-100 there is a gradual decrease. When m is around
    % 140, most of the units from this group tend to get out of the subset.
    % Therefore the value of mmd becomes much smaller than it should be.
    % Please note the dip around step m=140, which is due to entrance of the
    % units of the second larger group. This trajectory just after the dip
    % collapses into the trajectory which starts from the second group.
    % Please use
    % mdrrsplot with option databrush in order to explore the units
    % belonging to subset. Here we limit ourselves to notice that around m
    % =180 all the units from second group are included into subset (plus
    % some of group 1 given that the two groups partially overlap). Also
    % notice once again the decrease in the unique trajectory of minimum
    % Mahalanobis residual after m around 180 which is due to the entry of the
    % units of the first smaller group.
