%
% Required input arguments:
%
%           y:  Time series to analyze. Vector. A row or a column vector
%               with T elements, which contains the time series.
%
% Optional input arguments:
%
%      model :  Model type. Structure. A structure which specifies the model
%               which will be used. The model structure contains the following
%               fields:
%               model.s = scalar (length of seasonal period). For monthly
%                         data s=12 (default), for quartely data s=4, ...
%               model.trend = scalar (order of the trend component).
%                       trend = 1 implies linear trend with intercept (default),
%                       trend = 2 implies quadratic trend ...
%                       Admissible values for trend are, 0, 1, 2 and 3.
%               model.seasonal = scalar (integer specifying number of
%                        frequencies, i.e. harmonics, in the seasonal
%                        component. Possible values for seasonal are
%                        $1, 2, ..., [s/2]$, where $[s/2]=floor(s/2)$.
%                        For example:
%                        if seasonal =1 (default) we have:
%                        $\beta_1 \cos( 2 \pi t/s) + \beta_2 sin ( 2 \pi t/s)$;
%                        if seasonal =2 we have:
%                        $\beta_1 \cos( 2 \pi t/s) + \beta_2 \sin ( 2 \pi t/s)
%                        + \beta_3 \cos(4 \pi t/s) + \beta_4 \sin (4 \pi t/s)$.
%                        Note that when $s$ is even the sine term disappears
%                        for $j=s/2$ and so the maximum number of
%                        trigonometric parameters is $s-1$.
%                        If seasonal is a number greater than 100 then it
%                        is possible to specify how the seasonal component
%                        grows over time.
%                        For example, seasonal =101 implies a seasonal
%                        component which just uses one frequency
%                        which grows linearly over time as follows:
%                        $(1+\beta_3 t)\times ( \beta_1 cos( 2 \pi t/s) +
%                        \beta_2 \sin ( 2 \pi t/s))$.
%                        For example, seasonal =201 implies a seasonal
%                        component which just uses one frequency
%                        which grows in a quadratic way over time as
%                        follows:
%                        $(1+\beta_3 t + \beta_4  t^2)\times( \beta_1 \cos(
%                        2 \pi t/s) + \beta_2 \sin ( 2 \pi t/s))$.
%                        seasonal =0 implies a non seasonal model.
%               model.X  =  matrix of size T-by-nexpl containing the
%                         values of nexpl extra covariates which are likely
%                         to affect y.
%               model.posLS = positive integer which specifies to position
%                         to include the level shift component.
%                         For example if model.posLS =13 then the
%                         explanatory variable $I(t \geq 13})$ is created.
%                         If this field is not present or if it is empty,
%                         the level shift component is not included.
%               model.B  = column vector or matrix containing the initial
%                         values of parameter estimates which have to be
%                         used in the maximization procedure. If model.B is
%                         a matrix, then initial estimates are extracted
%                         from the first colum of this matrix. If this
%                         field is empty or if this field is not present,
%                         the initial values to be used in the maximization
%                         procedure are referred to the OLS parameter
%                         estimates of the linear part of the model. The
%                         parameters associated to time varying amplitude
%                         are initially set to 0.
%                 Example - 'model', model
%                 Data Types - struct
%               Remark: the default model is for monthly data with a linear
%               trend (2 parameters) + seasonal component with just one
%               harmonic (2 parameters), no additional explanatory
%               variables and no level shift that is
%                               model=struct;
%                               model.s=12;
%                               model.trend=1;
%                               model.seasonal=1;

%                               model.posLS='';
%       nsamp   : Number of subsamples which will be extracted to find the
%                 robust estimator. Scalar. If nsamp=0 all subsets will be extracted.
%                 They will be (n choose p).
%                 If the number of all possible subset is <1000 the
%                 default is to extract all subsets otherwise just 1000.
%                 Example - 'nsamp',1000
%                 Data Types - double
%       lms     : Criterion to use to find the initial subset to initialize
%                 the search. Scalar,  vector or structure. lms specifies
%                 the criterion to use to find the initial subset to
%                 initialize the search (LTS with concentration steps or
%                 subset supplied directly by the user).
%                 The default value is 1 (Least trimmed squares
%                 is computed to initialize the search).
%                 If lms is a struct it is possible to control a
%                 series of options for concentration steps (for more
%                 details see function LTSts.m)
%                 If, on the other hand, the user wants to initialize the
%                 search with a prespecified set of units there are two
%                 possibilities:
%                 1) lms can be a vector with length greater than 1 which
%                 contains the list of units forming the initial subset. For
%                 example, if the user wants to initialize the search
%                 with units 4, 6 and 10 then lms=[4 6 10];
%                 2) lms is a struct which contains a field named bsb which
%                 contains the list of units to initialize the search. For
%                 example, in the case of simple regression through the
%                 origin with just one explanatory variable, if the user
%                 wants to initialize the search with unit 3 then
%                 lms=struct; lms.bsb=3;
%                 Example - 'lms',1
%                 Data Types - double
%           h   : The number of observations that have determined the least
%                 trimmed squares estimator. Scalar. h is an integer
%                 greater or equal than p but smaller then n. Generally if
%                 the purpose is outlier detection h=[0.5*(n+p+1)] (default
%                 value). h can be smaller than this threshold if the
%                 purpose is to find subgroups of homogeneous observations.
%                 In this function the LTSts estimator is used just to
%                 initialize the search. The default value of h which is
%                 used is round(0.75*T).
%                 Example - 'h',round(n*0.55)
%                 Data Types - double
%       plots   : Plot on the screen. Scalar.
%                 If plots=1 (default) the plot of minimum deletion
%                 residual with envelopes based on T observations and the
%                 scatterplot matrix with the outliers highlighted is
%                 produced together with a two panel plot.
%                 The upper panel contains the orginal time series with
%                 fitted values. The bottom panel will contain the plot
%                 of robust residuals against index number. The confidence
%                 level which is used to draw the horizontal lines associated
%                 with the bands for the residuals is 0.999.
%                 If plots=2 the user can also monitor the intermediate
%                 plots based on envelope superimposition.
%                 Else no plot is produced.
%                 Example - 'plots',1
%                 Data Types - double
%      init :   Start of monitoring point. Scalar.
%               It specifies the point where to initialize the search and
%               start monitoring required diagnostics. If it is not
%               specified it is set equal floor(0.5*(T+1))
%               Example - 'init',100 starts monitoring from step m=100
%               Data Types - double
%       nocheck : Check input arguments inside input option model.
%               As default nocheck=0.
%               Example - 'nocheck',1
%               Data Types - double
%    bivarfit : Superimpose bivariate least square lines. Character. This option adds
%                 one or more least squares lines, based on
%                 SIMPLE REGRESSION of y on Xi, to the plots of y|Xi.
%                 bivarfit = ''
%                   is the default: no line is fitted.
%                 bivarfit = '1'
%                   fits a single ols line to all points of each bivariate
%                   plot in the scatter matrix y|X.
%                 bivarfit = '2'
%                   fits two ols lines: one to all points and another to
%                   the group of the genuine observations. The group of the
%                   potential outliers is not fitted.
%                 bivarfit = '0'
%                   fits one ols line to each group. This is useful for the
%                   purpose of fitting mixtures of regression lines.
%                 bivarfit = 'i1' or 'i2' or 'i3' etc. fits
%                   an ols line to a specific group, the one with
%                   index 'i' equal to 1, 2, 3 etc. Again, useful in case
%                   of mixtures.
%               Example - 'bivarfit','2'
%               Data Types - char
%       multivarfit : Superimpose multivariate least square lines. Character.
%                 This option adds one or more least square lines, based on
%                 MULTIVARIATE REGRESSION of y on X, to the plots of y|Xi.
%                 multivarfit = ''
%                   is the default: no line is fitted.
%                 multivarfit = '1'
%                   fits a single ols line to all points of each bivariate
%                   plot in the scatter matrix y|X. The line added to the
%                   scatter plot y|Xi is avconst + Ci*Xi, where Ci is the
%                   coefficient of Xi in the multivariate regression and
%                   avconst is the effect of all the other explanatory
%                   variables different from Xi evaluated at their centroid
%                   (that is overline{y}'C))
%                 multivarfit = '2'
%                   equal to multivarfit ='1' but this time we also add the
%                   line based on the group of unselected observations
%                   (i.e. the normal units).
%               Example - 'multivarfit','1'
%               Data Types - char
%      labeladd : Add outlier labels in plot. Character. If this option is
%                 '1',  we label the outliers with the
%                 unit row index in matrices X and y. The default value is
%                 labeladd='', i.e. no label is added.
%               Example - 'labeladd','1'
%               Data Types - char
%       nameX  : Add variable labels in plot. Cell array of strings. Cell
%                 array of strings of length p containing the labels of
%                 the variables of the regression dataset. If it is empty
%                 (default) the sequence X1, ..., Xp will be created
%                 automatically
%               Example - 'nameX',{'NameVar1','NameVar2'}
%               Data Types - cell
%       namey  :  Add response label. Character. String containing the
%                 label of the response
%               Example - 'namey','NameOfResponse'
%               Data Types - char
%       ylim   :  Control y scale in plot. Vector. Vector with two elements controlling minimum and maximum
%                 on the y axis. Default value is '' (automatic scale)
%               Example - 'ylim',[0,10] sets the minimum value to 0 and the
%               max to 10 on the y axis
%               Data Types - double
%       xlim   : Control x scale in plot. Vector. Vector with two elements
%               minimum and maximum on the x axis. Default value is ''
%               (automatic scale)
%               Example - 'xlim',[0,10] sets the minimum value to 0 and the
%               max to 10 on the x axis
%               Data Types - double
%      bonflev  : Signal to use to identify outliers. Scalar. Option to be
%                used if the distribution of the data is
%                 strongly non normal and, thus, the general signal
%                 detection rule based on consecutive exceedances cannot be
%                 used. In this case bonflev can be:
%                 - a scalar smaller than 1 which specifies the confidence
%                   level for a signal and a stopping rule based on the
%                   comparison of the minimum MD with a
%                   Bonferroni bound. For example if bonflev=0.99 the
%                   procedure stops when the trajectory exceeds for the
%                   first time the 99% bonferroni bound.
%                 - A scalar value greater than 1. In this case the
%                   procedure stops when the residual trajectory exceeds
%                   for the first time this value.
%                 Default value is '', which means to rely on general rules
%                 based on consecutive exceedances.
%               Example - 'bonflev',0.99
%               Data Types - double
%       msg    :  Level of output to display. Scalar. It controls whether
%                 to display or not messages on the screen
%                 If msg==1 (default) messages are displayed on the screen about
%                   step in which signal took place
%                 else no message is displayed on the screen.
%               Example - 'msg',1
%               Data Types - double
% bsbmfullrank : Dealing with singluar X matrix. Scalar. This option tells
%                 how to behave in case subset at step m
%                 (say bsbm) produces a singular X. In other words,
%                 this options controls what to do when rank(X(bsbm,:)) is
%                 smaller then number of explanatory variables. If
%                 bsbmfullrank =1 (default) these units (whose number is
%                 say mnofullrank) are constrained to enter the search in
%                 the final n-mnofullrank steps else the search continues
%                 using as estimate of beta at step m the estimate of beta
%                 found in the previous step.

% Output:

%
% out.ListOut  = k x 1 vector containing the list of the units declared as
%                outliers or NaN if the sample is homogeneous
% out.outliers = out.ListOut. This field is added for homogeneity with the
%                other robust estimators.
% out.beta   = Matrix containing estimated beta coefficients,

%                       The content of matrix out.beta is as follows:
%                       1st col = beta coefficients
%                        The order of the beta coefficients is as follows:
%                        1) trend elements (if present). If the trend is
%                        of order two there are r+1 coefficients if the
%                        intercept is present otherwise there are just r

%                        3) coefficients associated with the matrix of
%                        explanatory variables which have a potential effect
