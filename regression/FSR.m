% Required input arguments:
%
%    y:         Response variable. Vector. Response variable, specified as
%               a vector of length n, where n is the number of
%               observations. Each entry in y is the response for the
%               corresponding row of X.
%               Missing values (NaN's) and infinite values (Inf's) are
%               allowed, since observations (rows) with missing or infinite
%               values will automatically be excluded from the
%               computations.
%  X :          Predictor variables. Matrix. Matrix of explanatory
%               variables (also called 'regressors') of dimension n x (p-1)
%               where p denotes the number of explanatory variables
%               including the intercept.
%               Rows of X represent observations, and columns represent
%               variables. By default, there is a constant term in the
%               model, unless you explicitly remove it using input option
%               intercept, so do not include a column of 1s in X. Missing
%               values (NaN's) and infinite values (Inf's) are allowed,
%               since observations (rows) with missing or infinite values
%               will automatically be excluded from the computations.
%
% Optional input arguments:
%
%    intercept :  Indicator for constant term. true (default) | false. 
%                 Indicator for the constant term (intercept) in the fit,
%                 specified as the comma-separated pair consisting of
%                 'Intercept' and either true to include or false to remove
%                 the constant term from the model.
%                 Example - 'intercept',false
%                 Data Types - boolean
%           h   : The number of observations that have determined the least
%                 trimmed squares estimator. Scalar. h is an integer
%                 greater or equal than p but smaller then n. Generally if
%                 the purpose is outlier detection h=[0.5*(n+p+1)] (default
%                 value). h can be smaller than this threshold if the
%                 purpose is to find subgroups of homogeneous observations.
%                 In this function the LTS/LMS estimator is used just to
%                 initialize the search.
%                 Example - 'h',round(n*0,75)
%                 Data Types - double
%       nsamp   : Number of subsamples which will be extracted to find the
%                 robust estimator. Scalar. If nsamp=0 all subsets will be extracted.
%                 They will be (n choose p).
%                 If the number of all possible subset is <1000 the
%                 default is to extract all subsets otherwise just 1000.
%                 Example - 'nsamp',1000
%                 Data Types - double
%       lms     : Criterion to use to find the initial
%                 subset to initialize the search. Scalar,  vector or structure.
%                 lms specifies the criterion to use to find the initial
%                 subset to initialize the search (LMS, LTS with
%                 concentration steps, LTS without concentration steps
%                 or subset supplied directly by the user).
%                 The default value is 1 (Least Median of Squares
%                 is computed to initialize the search). On the other hand,
%                 if the user wants to initialze the search with LTS with
%                 all the default options for concentration steps then
%                 lms=2. If the user wants to use LTS without
%                 concentration steps, lms can be a scalar different from 1
%                 or 2. If lms is a struct it is possible to control a
%                 series of options for concentration steps (for more
%                 details see option lms inside LXS.m)
%                 LXS.m.
%                 If, on the other hand, the user wants to initialize the
%                 search with a prespecified set of units there are two
%                 possibilities:
%                 1) lms can be a vector with length greater than 1 which
%                 contains the list of units forming the initial subset. For
%                 example, if the user wants to initialize the search
%                 with units 4, 6 and 10 then lms=[4 6 10];
%                 2) lms is a struct which contains a field named bsb which
%                 contains the list of units to initialize the search. For
%                 example, in the case of simple regression through the
%                 origin with just one explanatory variable, if the user
%                 wants to initialize the search with unit 3 then
%                 lms=struct; lms.bsb=3;
%                 Example - 'lms',1
%                 Data Types - double
%       plots   : Plot on the screen. Scalar.
%                 If plots=1 (default) the plot of minimum deletion
%                 residual with envelopes based on n observations and the
%                 scatterplot matrix with the outliers highlighted is
%                 produced.
%                 If plots=2 the user can also monitor the intermediate
%                 plots based on envelope superimposition.
%                 Else no plot is produced.
%                 Example - 'plots',1
%                 Data Types - double
%       init    : Search initialization. Scalar. It specifies the initial subset size to start
%                 monitoring exceedances of minimum deletion residual, if
%                 init is not specified it set equal to:
%                   p+1, if the sample size is smaller than 40;
%                   min(3*p+1,floor(0.5*(n+p+1))), otherwise.
%               Example - 'init',100 starts monitoring from step m=100
%               Data Types - double
%       nocheck : Check input arguments. Scalar. If nocheck is equal to 1 no check is performed on
%                 matrix y and matrix X. Notice that y and X are left
%                 unchanged. In other words the additional column of ones
%                 for the intercept is not added. As default nocheck=0.
%               Example - 'nocheck',1
%               Data Types - double
%    bivarfit : Superimpose bivariate least square lines. Character. This option adds
%                 one or more least squares lines, based on
%                 SIMPLE REGRESSION of y on Xi, to the plots of y|Xi.
%                 bivarfit = ''
%                   is the default: no line is fitted.
%                 bivarfit = '1'
%                   fits a single ols line to all points of each bivariate
%                   plot in the scatter matrix y|X.
%                 bivarfit = '2'
%                   fits two ols lines: one to all points and another to
%                   the group of the genuine observations. The group of the
%                   potential outliers is not fitted.
%                 bivarfit = '0'
%                   fits one ols line to each group. This is useful for the
%                   purpose of fitting mixtures of regression lines.
%                 bivarfit = 'i1' or 'i2' or 'i3' etc. fits
%                   an ols line to a specific group, the one with
%                   index 'i' equal to 1, 2, 3 etc. Again, useful in case
%                   of mixtures.
%               Example - 'bivarfit','2'
%               Data Types - char
%       multivarfit : Superimpose multivariate least square lines. Character.
%                 This option adds one or more least square lines, based on
%                 MULTIVARIATE REGRESSION of y on X, to the plots of y|Xi.
%                 multivarfit = ''
%                   is the default: no line is fitted.
%                 multivarfit = '1'
%                   fits a single ols line to all points of each bivariate
%                   plot in the scatter matrix y|X. The line added to the
%                   scatter plot y|Xi is avconst + Ci*Xi, where Ci is the
%                   coefficient of Xi in the multivariate regression and
%                   avconst is the effect of all the other explanatory
%                   variables different from Xi evaluated at their centroid
%                   (that is overline{y}'C))
%                 multivarfit = '2'
%                   equal to multivarfit ='1' but this time we also add the
%                   line based on the group of unselected observations
%                   (i.e. the normal units).
%               Example - 'multivarfit','1'
%               Data Types - char
%      labeladd : Add outlier labels in plot. Character. If this option is
%                 '1',  we label the outliers with the
%                 unit row index in matrices X and y. The default value is
%                 labeladd='', i.e. no label is added.
%               Example - 'labeladd','1'
%               Data Types - char
%       nameX  : Add variable labels in plot. Cell array of strings. Cell
%                 array of strings of length p containing the labels of
%                 the variables of the regression dataset. If it is empty
%                 (default) the sequence X1, ..., Xp will be created
%                 automatically
%               Example - 'nameX',{'NameVar1','NameVar2'}
%               Data Types - cell
%       namey  :  Add response label. Character. String containing the
%                 label of the response
%               Example - 'namey','NameOfResponse'
%               Data Types - char
%       ylim   :  Control y scale in plot. Vector. Vector with two elements controlling minimum and maximum
%                 on the y axis. Default value is '' (automatic scale)
%               Example - 'ylim',[0,10] sets the minimum value to 0 and the
%               max to 10 on the y axis
%               Data Types - double
%       xlim   : Control x scale in plot. Vector. Vector with two elements
%               minimum and maximum on the x axis. Default value is ''
%               (automatic scale)
%               Example - 'xlim',[0,10] sets the minimum value to 0 and the
%               max to 10 on the x axis
%               Data Types - double
%      bonflev  : Signal to use to identify outliers. Scalar. Option to be
%                used if the distribution of the data is
%                 strongly non normal and, thus, the general signal
%                 detection rule based on consecutive exceedances cannot be
%                 used. In this case bonflev can be:
%                 - a scalar smaller than 1 which specifies the confidence
%                   level for a signal and a stopping rule based on the
%                   comparison of the minimum MD with a
%                   Bonferroni bound. For example if bonflev=0.99 the
%                   procedure stops when the trajectory exceeds for the
%                   first time the 99% bonferroni bound.
%                 - A scalar value greater than 1. In this case the
%                   procedure stops when the residual trajectory exceeds
%                   for the first time this value.
%                 Default value is '', which means to rely on general rules
%                 based on consecutive exceedances.
%               Example - 'bonflev',0.99
%               Data Types - double
%  threshoutX  : threshold to bound the effect of high leverage units.
%                empty value (default) or scalar or structure.
%               If the design matrix X contains several high leverage units
%               (that is units which are very far from the bulk of the
%               data), it may happen that the best subset of LXS may include some
%               of these units, or it may happen that these units have a
%               deletion residual which is very small due to their
%               extremely high value of $h_i$. bonflevoutX=1 imposes the
%               constraints that:
%               1) the extracted subsets which contain
%               at least one unit declared as outlier in the X space by FSM
%               using a Bonferronized confidence level of 0.99
%               are removed from the list of candidate subsets to find the
%               LXS solution.
%               2) imposes the contrainst that $h_i(m^*)$
%               cannot exceed $10 \times p/m$.
%               If threshoutX is a structure, it contains the following
%               fields:
%               threshoutX.bonflevoutX = specifies the Bonferronized
%               confidence level to be used to find the outliers in the X
%               space. If this field is not present a 99 per cent
%               confidence level is used.
%               threshoutX.threshlevoutX = specifies the threshold to bound
%               the effect of high leverage units in the computation of
%               deletion residuals. In the computation of
%               the quantity $h_i(m^*) = x_i^T\{X(m^*)^TX(m^*)\}^{-1}x_i$,
%               $i \notin S^{(m)}_*$, units which very far from the bulk of
%               the data (represented by $X(m^*)$) will have a huge value
%               of $h_i(m^*)$ and consequently of the deletion residuals.
%               In order to tackle this problem it is possible to put a
%               bound to the value of $h_i(m^*)$. For example
%               threshoutX.threshlevoutX=r imposes the contrainst that $h_i(m^*)$
%               cannot exceed $r \times p/m$. If this field is not present
%               the default threshold of 10 is imposed.
%               Example - 'threshoutX',1
%               Data Types - double
%       msg    :  Level of output to display. Scalar. It controls whether
%                 to display or not messages on the screen
%                 If msg==1 (default) messages are displayed on the screen about
%                   step in which signal took place
%                 else no message is displayed on the screen.
%               Example - 'msg',1
%               Data Types - double
% bsbmfullrank : Dealing with singluar X matrix. Scalar. This option tells
%                 how to behave in case subset at step m
%                 (say bsbm) produces a singular X. In other words,
%                 this options controls what to do when rank(X(bsbm,:)) is
%                 smaller then number of explanatory variables. If
%                 bsbmfullrank =1 (default) these units (whose number is
%                 say mnofullrank) are constrained to enter the search in
%                 the final n-mnofullrank steps else the search continues
%                 using as estimate of beta at step m the estimate of beta
%                 found in the previous step.
%               Example - 'bsbmfullrank',1
%               Data Types - double

% Output:
%
%         out:   structure which contains the following fields
%
% out.ListOut  = k x 1 vector containing the list of the units declared as
%                outliers or NaN if the sample is homogeneous
% out.outliers = out.ListOut. This field is added for homogeneity with the
%                other robust estimators.
% out.beta   =  p-by-1 vector containing the estimated regression

%               Second row contains the frequency distribution.
% out.constr  = This output is produced only if the search found at a
