%
%  Required input arguments:
%
%       nsamp : Number of subsamples which have to be extracted. Scalar;
%               if nsamp=0 all subsets will be extracted; they will be (n
%               choose p).
%               Data Types - single|double
%         n   : Number of observations of the dataset. Scalar.
%               Data Types - single|double
%         p   : Size of the subsets. Scalar. In regression with p
%               explanatory variable the size of the elmental subsets is p;
%               in multivariate analysis, in presence of v variables,
%               the size of the elemental subsets is v+1.
%               Data Types - single|double
%
%  Optional input arguments:
%
%       ncomb : scalar (n choose p). If the user has already computed this
%               value it can supply it directly, otherwise the program will
%               calculate it automatically.
%               Example - C=subsets(20,10,3,120)
%               Data Types - single|double
%
%        msg  : scalar which controls whether to display or not messages
%               on the screen. If msg=1 (default), messages are displayed
%               on the screen about estimated time.
%               Example - C=subsets(20,10,3,120,0)
%               Data Types - boolean
%
%   method : Sampling methods. Scalar or vector.
%            Methods used to extract the subsets. See section 'More About'
%            of function randsampleFS.m for details about the sampling
%            methods. Default is method = 1.
%            - Scalar, from 0 to 3 determining the (random sample without
%            replacement) method to be used.
%            - Vector of weights: in such a case, Weighted Sampling Without
%              Replacement is applied using that vector of weights.
%            Example - randsampleFS(100,10,2)
%            Data Types - single|double
%
%
%  Output:
%
%
%           C : The indices of the subsets which need to be extracted.
%               Matrix with nselected rows and p columns (stored in int16 format).
%               Data Types - single|double
%
%   nselected : Number of rows of matrix C. Scalar.
