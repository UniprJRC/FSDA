%
%  Required input arguments:
%
%       n : A vector of numbers will be selected from the integers 1 to n.
%           Scalar, a positive integer.
%           Data Types - single|double
%      k  : The number of elements to be selected. Non negative integer.
%           Data Types - single|double
%
%  Optional input arguments:
%
%   method : Sampling methods. Scalar or vector.
%            Methods used to extract the subsets. See more about for details.
%            Default is method = 0.
%            - Scalar from 0 to 3 determining the method used to extract
%             (without replacement) the random sample.
%            - Vector of weights: in such a case, a weighted sampling without
%              replacement algorithm is applied using that vector of weights.
%            Example - randsampleFS(100,10,2)
%            Data Types - single|double
%
%after2011b: MATLAB version flag. Logical. Indicates if the MATLAB version 
%            in use is later than R2012a (7.14). Used to speed up
%            computations in function subsets and, more in general, in
%            simulation experiments which use randsampleFS intensively.
%            Example - randsampleFS(100,10,2,true) or
%            randsampleFS(100,10,2,~verLessThan('MATLAB','7.14'))
%            Data Types - logical
%
%   Output:
%
%   y :     A column vector of k values sampled at random from the integers 1:n.
%           For methods 0, 1, 2 and weighted sampling the elements  extracted
%           are unique; For method 3 (included for historical reasons) there is
%           no guarantee that the elements extracted are unique.
%           Data Types - single|double.
%
% More About:
%
%   The method=0 uses MATLAB function randperm. In old MATLAB releases
%   randperm was slower than FSDA function shuffling, which is used in
%   method 1 (for example, in R2009a - MATLAB 7.8 - randperm was at least
%   50% slower).  
%
%   If method=1 the approach depends on the population and sample sizes:
%   - if $n < 1000$ and $k < n/(10 + 0.007n)$, that is if the population is
%     relatively small and the desired sample is small compared to the
%     population, we repeatedly sample with replacement until there are k
%     unique values;
%   - otherwise, we do a random permutation of the population and return  
%     the first k elements. 
%   The threshold $k < n/(10 + 0.007n)$ has been determined by simulation
%   under MATLAB R2016b. Before, the threshold was $n < 4*k$.
%
%   If method=2 systematic sampling is used, where the starting point is
%   random and the step is also random. 
%
%   If method=3 random sampling is based on the old but well known Linear
%   Congruential Generator (LCG) method. In this case there is no guarantee
%   to get unique numbers. The method is included for historical reasons.
%
%   If method is a vector of n weights, then Weighted Sampling Without
%   Replacement is applied. Our implementation follows Efraimidis and
%   Spirakis (2006). MATLAB function datasample follows Wong and  Easton
%   (1980), which is also quite fast; note however that function datasample
%   may be very slow if applied repetedly, for the large amount of time
%   spent on options checking.
%
%   Remark on computation performances. Method=2 (systematic sampling) is
%   by far the fastest for any practical population size $n$. For example,
%   for $n \approx 10^6$ method=2 is two orders of magniture faster than
%   method=1. With recent MATLAB releases (after R2011b) method = 0 (which
%   uses compiled MATLAB function randperm) has comparable performances, at
%   least for reasonably small $k$. In releases before 2012a, randperm was
%   considerably slow.

%% Beginning of code

% randsampleFS needs to check the MATLAB version in use in order to:
% - decide the sempling method to use, and
% - use properly the optional parameter of randperm.
% In the first case  the release to check is R2012a, i.e. 7.14
% In the second case the release to check is R2011b, i.e. 7.13
% For the sake of computational efficiency, we just check the latest
% To pass the argument, use:
% after2012a = ~verLessThan('MATLAB','7.14');
if nargin < 4 
    after2011b = ~verLessThan('MATLAB','7.14');
end

% choose the default sampling method
if nargin < 3 || isempty(method)
    if after2011b
        method=0;
    else 
        % in older releases we use systematic sampling because randperm
        % function (used for method = 0) was extremely inefficient
        method=2;
    end
end

% Weighted Sampling Without Replacement
% This is done if the third argument is provided as a vector of weights.
