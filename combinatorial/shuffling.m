% More About:
%
% If set $x$ has $t$ elements, the objective is to obtain each of the $t!$
% pemutations with equal probability, especially when $t$ is large. To
% achieve this goal we use backward Knuth's shuffling, which is based on
% the Fisher-Yates shuffle.
%
% shuffling has been introduced as an alternative to MATLAB function
% randperm. Randperm makes a call to sort(rand(1,n)) and, overall, is
% slower than shuffling (for example, in R2009a shuffling was on average
% 25% faster). If compiled as mex file, shuffling becomes much more
% efficient than x(randperm(numel(x))) solution (it is about 60% faster for
% n=10^6). C code that can be used for this purpose is available at the
% http://it.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/27076-shuffle website
% as part of Jan Simon's Shuffle library.

    % Computation time of shuffling and randperm. 
    % An extensive test for various sample sizes.
    % REMARK: shuffling code is interpreted whereas randperm is compiled;
    % therefore, the comparison has to be done using tic-toc statements,

%% Beginning of code

n = numel(x);
I = n:-1:1;
J = ceil(rand(1,n) .* I);

for i=n:-1:1 
    % Note 1: to generate random integers between 1 and i, one by one in
    % the loop, would be less efficient. Such numbers are thus generated
    % outside the loop. To check, uncomment line below and profile the code.
    % j = ceil(rand() * i);
    % Note 2: this would be even less efficient: 
    % j = randi([1,i]);
    % Note 3: the double access to the vector on indices takes less time
    % than the allocation of the index in a separate variable with this line
    % j = J(i);
    
    % now, exchange element x[j] with x[i]. In MATLAB it would be
    % natural to do the exchange with a matrix operation, i.e. with 
    % x([i,j]) = x([j,i]).
    % Note that this switch forces MATLAB to pre-allocate a copy of x,
    % which takes time and, of corse, more memory. Using the MATLAB
    % profiler we found that the switch requires about 72% additional
    % time with respect to the following solution:
    t       = x(J(i));
    x(J(i)) = x(i);
    x(i)    = t;
end
