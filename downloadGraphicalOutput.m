%% Preamble
% The purpose of this file is to download and extract the graphical output
% of the html examples of FSDA contained in file
% http://rosa.unipr.it/FSDA/outputHTMLfiles.zip into
% (MATLAB docroot)/FSDA//images
% if this path exists
% or to
% (FSDA root)/helpfiles/FSDA/images.
% if the previous path does not exist.
%
% REMARK: this file is necessary just from those who have downloaded FSDA
% from Mathworks file exchange due to the limitation of 20MB size of the
% files inside fileexchange. Those who have downloaded FSDA from github do
% not need to run this file.
