  MixSim(k,v) generates k groups in v dimensions. It is possible to
  control the average and maximum or standard deviation of overlapping.

  Given two generic clusters $i$ and $j$ with $i \ne j =1, ..., k$,
  indexed by $\phi(x; \mu_i,\Sigma_i)$ and $\phi(x; \mu_j,\Sigma_j)$ with
  probabilities of occurrence $\pi_i$ and $\pi_j$, the misclassification
  probability with respect to cluster $i$ (that is conditionally on $x$
  belonging to cluster $i$,  which is called  $w_{j|i}$) is defined as
  $Pr[ \pi_i \phi(x;\mu_i,\Sigma_i) &lt; \pi_j \phi(x;\mu_j,\Sigma_j)]$.
  The matrix containing the misclassification probabilities $w_{j|i}$ is
  called OmegaMap
  The probability of overlapping between groups $i$ and $j$ is given by:
  \[
            w_{j|i} + w_{i|j}    \qquad      i,j=1,2, ..., k
  \]
  The diagonal elements of OmegaMap are equal to 1.
  The average overlap (which in the code is called below BarOmega) is
  defined as the sum of the off diagonal elements of OmegaMap (matrix of
  misclassification probabilities) divided by 0.5*k*(k-1)
  The maximum overlap (which in the code is called MaxOmega) is defined as
  $\max(w_{j|i} + w_{i|j}$),  $i \ne j=1,2, ..., k$.
  The probability of misclassification $w_{j|i}$ is nothing but the cdf of a linear
  combination of non central $\chi^2$ distributions with 1 degree of freedom
  + a linear combination of $N(0,1)$ evaluated in a
  point c.  The coefficients of the linear combinations of non central
  $\chi^2$ and $N(0,1)$ depend on the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of matrix
  $\Sigma_{j|i} = \Sigma^{0.5}_i \Sigma^{-1}_j \Sigma^{0.5}_i$.
  Point $c$ depends on the same eigenvalues and eigenvectors
  of matrix $\Sigma_{j|i}$, the mixing proportions $\pi_i$ and $\pi_j$ and the
  determinants $|\Sigma_i|$ and $|\Sigma_j|$.
  This probability is computed using routine ncx2mixtcdf.m
