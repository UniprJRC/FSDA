   pseudorandom numbers, generated in R and MATLAB using the Mersenne
   Twister algorithm mt19937ar, are identical. In the R community the
   problem is discussed (but only partially addressed) in the package
   'randtoolbox', available in CRAN.</P><h2>More About</h2><P>
   In R software, the random stream for the Mersenne Twister algorithm is
   generated by .Random.seed as a 624-dimensional set of 32-bit integers
   preceded by two additional integers: the first is a code for the kind
   of RNG and normal generator and the second is the current position in
   the random stream set. The lowest two decimal digits of the RNG code
   are in 0:(k-1) where k is the number of available RNGs; the hundreds
   represent the type of normal generator, starting at 0.

   The approach followed in this FSDA function to grant compatibility
   of random numbers generated in MATLAB and R relies on two key steps:
   - The state of the random number stream created in MATLAB is replaced
     with the stream received from R as imput argument. This step requires
     recasting the stream from the signed integers used by R and the
     unsigned counterparts used by MATLAB. The generated random stream
     is indipendent from the global stream.
   - The inverse transformation is used to compute a normal random
     variate (i.e. the standard normal inverse cumulative distribution
     function to a uniform random variate is applied). This replaces the
     MATLAB default, which is the ziggurat algorithm.

   The approach is applied in two possible ways, depending on user's
   input (Rstate argument):
   - In the first option, the R seed is given as input and the
     corresponding R, and then MATLAB, states are generated;
   - In the second option, a valid R state is given as input and the
     corresponding MATLAB state is then generated; Note that, since R does
     something non-standard when initializing from a seed, there is no
     way to map R seed values to MATLAB's (MATLAB initializes using the
     standard to mt19937ar seeding algorithm). So we initialize with
     seed = 0 to get the correct global generator, but then we set the
     generator state explicitly to the MATLAB equivalent of the R
     specification.

   Our solution grants retrocompatibility up to R2012a. Note the key
   changes in the syntax of MATLAB's RNG start-up:
   - prior to R2008b the setting was:
     rand('seed',0).
   - from R2008b:
     stream = RandStream('mt19937ar','Seed',5489);
     RandStream.setGlobalStream(stream).
   - from R2011a the current setting was adopted:
     rng default.
