<h1 class="title">Introduction to Dynamic Statistical Visualization</h1>

<p>The problem of representing data or any quantitative information in a graphical 
form suitable to human interpretation and exploration has deep roots and has been 
addressed in statistics and in many other scientific disciplines (Friendly 2005). 
One of the biggest challenges statisticians face when working on applied problems 
with non-statisticians is to be able to effectively present and communicate statistical 
results (Spence 2001, Tufte 1983). In this toolbox we have developed new interactive 
tools which can dynamically connect the information which comes from different “robust 
plots”. </p>
<p>The Flexible Statistics Data Analysis Toolbox&trade; extends the data visualization functions already present 
in the Statistics toolbox and in MATLAB. The extensions concern a series of robust 
statistics plots which we made dynamic and interactive. These new features not only 
help to better present the data to a non statistical audience, but also enable the 
researcher to highlight the presence of hidden subgroups of data.</p>

<p>MATLAB includes a data brushing facility for marking observations on graphs and 
allowing the user to remove or save them to new variables. There is also a related 
data linking facility for connecting graphs with workspace variables, to automatically 
and interactively update them. In the Forward Search context the applicability of such 
powerful functions is limited by the fact that with the link function two graphs 
can be connected, and therefore brushed, only when they refer to the same variables 
in the workspace. </p>
<p>For example, linking the Monitoring Residuals Plot with the Scatter 
Plot Matrix is not possible, as the former refers to the residuals of the data units 
at each step of the search, while the latter refers to the unit values. Besides, 
line plots created with <tt>line</tt> and the <tt>gplotmatrix</tt> function 
in particular cannot be brushed 
with the standard MATLAB brush function. </p>
<p>For these reasons in the FSDA toolbox we have re-implemented the brushing and 
linking facilities. In particular, we have adopted (and adapted to our needs) 
the&nbsp; powerful <tt>selectdata</tt> function by John 
D&#39;Errico, available at the MATLAB Central exchange user community (<a href="http://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/13857">http://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/13857</a>). 
</p>
<p>Brushing is implemented in the FSDA toolbox in two modalities. A <em>non persistent</em> modality 
where the selection can be done by the user only once and a <em>persistent</em> brushing 
where the selection can be repeated multiple times. In addition, there is a <em>persistent 
non cumulative</em> brush option, where every time a brushing action is performed previous 
selections are removed, and a cumulative one where each selection is highlighted 
and appropriately reported in the legend of the graphs involved.</p>
<p>The above features are complemented by our customized version of the standard Matlab 
	<a href="matlab:web(['jar:file:///',matlabroot,'/help/techdoc/help.jar!/creating_plots/f4-44221.html#f4-49948'],'-helpbrowser')">
<tt>datatip</tt></a>   option that, once a point in a forward trajectory is 
selected reports in a a tooltip box relevant information about the associated unit(s) and the 
related statistics.</p>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul type="disc">
	<li>
	<p><a href="statistical_visualization_monres.html">Monitoring Residuals plot</a> 
	is a basic visualization tool to identify outliers and more in general groups 
	of observations which behave differently from the rest of the data. In this 
	plot the option <tt>datatooltip</tt> can be used to provide information about 
	the unit selected, the step in which the unit enters the search and the associated 
	label. On the other hand, option <tt>databrush</tt> enables the user to select 
	a set of residual trajectories and to see them highlighted in the y|X plot, 
	i.e. a matrix of scatter plots of y against each column of X, grouped according 
	to the selection(s) done by brushing. If the plot y|X does not exist it is automatically 
	created. In addition, brushed units are automatically highlighted in other forward 
	plots (e.g. minimum deletion residual plot) if they are already open. </p>
	<li>
	<p><a href="statistical_visualization_mdr.html">Minimum Deletion Residual</a> 
	monitors the value of minimum deletion residual in each step of the forward 
	search. If one or more atypical observations are present in the data, the plot 
	of minimum deletion residual will show a peak in the step prior to the inclusion 
	of the first outlier. The plot may show a subsequent decrease, due to the effect 
	of masking, as further outliers enter the subset. In this plot the option
	<tt>datatooltip</tt> can be used to provide information about the unit(s) which 
	enter the search in the selected step. On the other hand, option <tt>databrush</tt> 
	enables the user to select a part of the curve of minimum deletion residual 
	and to see the corresponding units highlighted in the scatter plot matrix and 
	in other forward plots. </p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p><a href="statistical_visualization_fan.html">Fan plot</a> helps you identify 
	the best value of the <a href="transf_intro.html">Box-Cox transformation</a> parameter for the response of your 
	regression model. The fan plot allows assessment of the proportion of the data 
	supporting a particular transformation, information not available from other 
	methods of analysis. In this plot the option <tt>
	datatooltip</tt> 
	can be used to provide information about the unit(s) which enter the search 
	in the selected step. On the other hand, option <tt>databrush</tt> enables 
	the user to select a part of the curve(s) which make up the fan plot and to see the 
	corresponding units highlighted in the scatter plot matrix of transformed 
	and untransfomred data and in other forward plots. </p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p><a href="statistical_visualization_yx.html">yXplot</a>  
	plots the dependent variable against the columns of the independent variables 
	in the input dataset. The function, based on the MATLAB <tt>gplotmatrix</tt> 
	function, allows to select units in one of the scatter plots and to produce 
	automatically a Monitoring Residuals plot in which labels are put for the units 
	which fulfill various user defined criteria.  </p>
