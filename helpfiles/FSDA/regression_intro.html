	<h2 class="title">Introduction to robust estimators in linear regression</h2>

Standard Linear Regression Models are based on certain assumptions, such as a normal 
distribution of errors in the observed responses, omoscedasticity. If the distribution 
of errors is asymmetric or prone to outliers, model assumptions are invalidated, 
and parameter estimates, confidence intervals, and other computed statistics become 
unreliable. Outliers occur very frequently in real data, and they often go unnoticed 
because nowadays data are processes by computers, without careful inspection or 
screening. Not only the response variable can be outlying, but also the explanatory 
part, leading to so-called leverage points. Both types of outliers may totally spoil 
the analysis carried out by ordinary least squares. Often, such influential points 
remain hidden to the user, because they do not always show up in the usual least 
squares plots.
<p>&nbsp;</p>
To remedy this problem, new statistical techniques have been developed that are 
not so easily affected by outliers. These are the so called robust methods. The 
Statistics Toolbox function robustfit implements 
a robust fitting method that is less sensitive than ordinary least squares to large 
changes in small parts of the data. Robust regression implemented in Statistics 
Toolbox works by assigning a weight to each data point. Weighting is done automatically 
and iteratively using a process called
<a class="indexterm" name="zmw57dd0e14812"></a><span class="emphasis"><em>iteratively 
reweighted least squares</em>. In the first iteration, each point is assigned 
equal weight and model coefficients are estimated using ordinary least squares. 
At subsequent iterations, weights are recomputed so that points farther from model 
predictions in the previous iteration are given lower weight. Model coefficients 
are then recomputed using weighted least squares. The process continues until the 
values of the coefficient estimates converge within a specified tolerance.
</span>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;</p>
&nbsp;Two popular regression estimators which asymptotically have a breakdown point 
equal to 0.5 are the Least Median of Squares (LMS) and the Least trimmed squares 
(LTS) (Rousseeuuw and Leroy, 1987). The LTS regression method minimizes the sum 
of the <em>h</em> smallest squared residuals, where <em>h</em> must be at least 
half the number of observations. On the other hand the Least Median of Squares 
estimator minimizes the median of the squares of the residuals. The LTS and LMS 
are very robust methods in the sense that the estimated regression fit is not 
unduly influenced by outliers in the data, even if there are several outliers. 
Due to this robustness, we can detect outliers by their large LTS (LMS) 
residuals.<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>LTS and LMS use a weight function which is discontinuous. A viable 
alternative is to use a continuous weight function. This leads to the S and MM 
estimators.&nbsp; </p>
Because of the way in which models are fitted, either by least squares or by LTS, 
LMS, S, or MM, we can lose information about the effect 
of individual observations on inferences about the form and parameters of the model. 
The methods developed in this toolbox reveal how the fitted regression model depends 
on individual observations and on groups of observations. Robust procedures can 
sometimes reveal this structure, but downweight or discard some observations. The 
novelty in our approach to data analysis is to combine robustness and a “forward” 
search through the data with regression diagnostics and data visualization tools. We provide 
easily understood plots that use information from the whole sample to display the 
effect of each observation on a wide variety of aspects of the fitted model. <br>
<p>This chapter considers three procedures. </p>
<ul>
	<li>
	<p><a href="regression_lxs.html"><tt>LXS</tt></a> implements Least trimmed squares 
	and Least Median of Squares estimators. Using option <tt>rew</tt> it is also possible 
	to consider their raw version or their reweighted version. In these estimators 
	the percentage of trimming is fixed a priori and it is not possible to appraise 
	the effect that each statistical unit exerts on the fitted model. </p>
	</li>
	
	<li>
	<p><a href="regression_mms.html"><tt>Sreg</tt> and <tt>Smult</tt></a> implement S and MM estimators 
	in linear regression. In the S procedure, similarly to what happens for LXS, 
	the breakdown point is fixed a priori. Once a robust estimate of the scale 
	is found, one can obtain a nominal efficiency by using the S estimate as the 
	starting point for an iterative procedure leading to MM estimators.&nbsp;   
	</li>
	
	<li>
	<p><a href="regression_fsr.html"><tt>FSR</tt></a> and
	<a href="regression_fsreda.html"><tt>FSReda</tt></a> provide two routines which 
	implement the forward search in linear regression. <br>
	<a href="regression_fsr.html"><tt>FSR</tt></a> implements an automatic outlier 
	detection procedure which has a simultaneous alpha close to the nominal and 
	a great power. <br>
	<a href="regression_fsreda.html"><tt>FSReda</tt></a> has exploratory purposes. 
	It enables to store a series of quantities along the forward search (residuals, 
	leverage, minimum deletion residual outside subset, maximum studentized residual, 
	units belonging to subset in each step and other tests). Through the joint analysis 
	of the plots which monitor the progression of the statistics along the forward 
	search it is immediately clear to detect the observations that differ from the 
	bulk of the data. These may be individual observations that do not belong to 
	the general model, that is outliers. Or there may be a subset of the data that 
	is systematically different from the majority. The monitoring of the progression 
	of the statistics along the search not only enables the identification of such 
	observations, but also let us appraise the effect that they have on parameter 
	estimates and on inferences about models and their suitability. </p>
