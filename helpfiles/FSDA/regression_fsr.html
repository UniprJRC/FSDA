	<h2 id="bqvsgfl-1" class="title">Forward search in linear regression with automatic 
outlier detection procedure</h2>
<p class="purpose">The forward search in linear regression used for outlier detection 
purposes examines the minimum deletion residual among observations that are not 
in the subset (say of size $m$). If this ordered observation $[m+1]$ is an outlier relative 
to the other m observations, its residual will be ‘large" compared with the maximum 
residual of observations in the subset. In uncalibrated use of the minimum deletion 
residual to detect outliers the decision whether a difference in distances is ‘large" 
is subjective, without reference to any null distribution. To calibrate the forward 
search and so to provide an objective basis for decisions about the number of outliers 
in a sample we have found the distribution of the minimum deletion residual in the 
forward search. The output is a series of theoretical simultaneous confidence bands 
(envelopes) associated to the quantiles of the distribution of the minimum deletion 
residual. </p>
<p>To use the envelopes in the forward search for outlier detection we follow a 
two-stage process. In the first stage we run a search on the data, monitoring the 
bounds for all $n$ observations until we obtain a "signal" indicating that observation $m^{\dagger}$ therefore succeeding observations, may be outliers, because the value 
of the statistic lies beyond our threshold. In the context of signal detection, 
we have tried to take into account the fact that the envelopes of minimum deletion 
residual outside subset consist roughly of three parts; an initial decreasing part, 
a "central" roughly flat part and a steeply curving "final" part. Once a signal 
has been found (e.g. three consecutive values of minimum deletion residual above 
a certain threshold), we superimpose envelopes for values of n from this point until 
the first time that we introduce an observation we recognize as an outlier. </p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Example 1</h3>
<p>In order to illustrate how the procedure works we concentrate our 
attention on the same dataset (loyalty cards) which had already been analyzed in 
pages &quot;Least trimmed squares (LTS) and Least median of squares (LMS)&quot; and &quot;Forward 
search in linear regression with exploratory data analysis (EDA) purposes&quot;.</p>
<p>The code below loads the data and launch the automatic outlier detection procedure</p>
<pre class="programlisting">
% Load the data
load(&#39;loyalty.txt&#39;);
nameX={&#39;Intercept&#39; &#39;Number of visits&#39;, &#39;Age&#39;, &#39;Number of persons in the family&#39;};
% define y and X
y=loyalty(:,4);
X=loyalty(:,1:3);
% transform y
y1=y.^(0.4);
% Use function FSR (Forward search in linear regression with automatic outlier detection purposes)
[out]=FSR(y1,X);
</pre>
The first relevant exceedance takes place at step m=487 because in this step the 
observed value of the minimum deletion residual is above the 99.999% threshold.
<p><img alt="" height="561" src="plots/regression_fsr01.jpg" width="1040"></p>
<p>When $m = 486$ the curve lies well within the envelopes. Around $m = 490$
the observed curve starts getting closer to the 99% envelope.
The first time the curve goes out of the 99%
envelope is step $m = 492$.

The procedure of resuperimposing envelopes stops when $m = 492$ because this is
the first time in which we have a value of $d_{\min}(m)$ for $m \geq m^{\dagger}$ greater than 99%
threshold.

<a name="bq24of9-11"></a>
<p>The stopping rule and the signal have been calibrated in such a way that 
the size of the test is close to the nominal.</p>
<p>The final plot which the automatic outlier detection procedure produces is the one 
which shows the response against the column of matrix $X$ with the units which have been
declared as outliers shown with a different symbol.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="plots/regression_fsr04.jpg"></p>
<h3>Example 2</h3>
<p>We now apply the automatic outlier detection procedure to the Hawkins data</p>

<pre class="programlisting">
load('hawkins.txt');
y=hawkins(:,9);
X=hawkins(:,1:8);
% Use function FSR (Forward search in linear regression with automatic outlier detection purposes)
[out]=FSR(y,X,'nsamp',1000,'ylim',[1 6],'xlim',[30 90]);
</pre>
<p>The plot below shows the step in which the signal takes place.</p>
<p><img src="plots/regression_fsr05.jpg" height="560" width="1080"></p>

<p>Envelopes superimposition stops in step $m=87$. In this dataset the units not 
declared as outliers are 86.</p>
<p><img src="plots/regression_fsr06.jpg" height="545" width="1087"></p>
<p>The image below shows what appears automatically in the command window 
summarizes the information about the signal and the stopping rule together 
with the number of times the empirical curve of minimum deletion residual fell above the extreme thresholds..</p>
