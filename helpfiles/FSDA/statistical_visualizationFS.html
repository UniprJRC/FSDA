<hr>The forward search is a powerful general method for detecting multiple masked 
outliers and for determining their effect on inferences about models fitted to data. 
From the monitoring of a series of statistics based on subsets of data of increasing 
size we obtain multiple views of any hidden structure.&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;</p>
Often it happens that a lot of interesting features emerge unexpectedly during the 
progression of the forward search only when a specific combination of forward plots 
is inspected at the same time. Thus, the analyst should be able to interact with 
the plots and redefine or refine the links among them. In the absence of dynamic 
linking and interaction tools, the analyst risks to miss relevant hidden information. 
Therefore, in this toolbox we provide the user with flexible interaction tools.
<p>&nbsp;</p>
Using option <tt>databrush</tt> in the graphical functions (e.g. <tt>
<a href="resfwdplot.html">resfwdplot</a></tt> or <tt><a href="mdrplot.html">mdrplot</a></tt>) 
it is possible to select the trajectories of the monitoring residuals plot and to 
see them highlighted in the minimum deletion residual and in the scatter plot matrix. 
Similarly, it is possible to start brushing from the minimum deletion residual or 
from the scatter plot matrix and to see highlighted the corresponding trajectories 
in the monitoring residuals plot.
<p></p>
<p>MATLAB includes a data brushing facility for marking observations on graphs and 
allowing the user to remove or save them to new variables. There is also a related 
data linking facility for connecting graphs with workspace variables, to automatically 
and interactively update them. In the Forward Search context the applicability of such 
powerful functions is limited by the fact that with the link function two graphs 
can be connected, and therefore brushed, only when they refer to the same variables 
in the workspace. </p>
<p>For example, linking the Monitoring Residuals Plot with the Scatter 
Plot Matrix is not possible, as the former refers to the residuals of the data units 
at each step of the search, while the latter refers to the unit values. Besides, 
line plots created with <tt>line</tt> and the <tt>gplotmatrix</tt> function 
in particular cannot be brushed 
with the standard MATLAB brush function. </p>
<p>For these reasons in the FSDA toolbox we have re-implemented the brushing and 
linking facilities. In particular, we have adopted (and adapted to our needs) 
the&nbsp; powerful <tt>selectdata</tt> function by John 
D&#39;Errico, available at the MATLAB Central exchange user community (<a href="http://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/13857">http://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/13857</a>). 
</p>
<p>Brushing is implemented in the FSDA toolbox in two modalities. A <em>non persistent</em> modality 
where the selection can be done by the user only once and a <em>persistent</em> brushing 
where the selection can be repeated multiple times. In addition, there is a <em>persistent 
non cumulative</em> brush option, where every time a brushing action is performed previous 
selections are removed, and a cumulative one where each selection is highlighted 
and appropriately reported in the legend of the graphs involved.</p>
<p>The above features are complemented by our customized version of the standard Matlab 
	<a href="matlab:web(['jar:file:///',matlabroot,'/help/techdoc/help.jar!/creating_plots/f4-44221.html#f4-49948'],'-helpbrowser')">
<tt>datatip</tt></a>   option that, once a point in a forward trajectory is 
selected reports in a a tooltip box relevant information about the associated unit(s) and the 
related statistics.</p>
