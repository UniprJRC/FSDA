	<h2 id="bqvsgfl-1" class="title">Monitoring Minimum Deletion Residual Plot</h2>
<a class="indexterm" name="zmw57dd0e2698"></a>
<p></p>
<p>For outlier detection it is useful to monitor the
minimum deletion residual r<sup>*</sup><sub>[<em>m</em>+1]</sub> among the units not belonging to the subset.
If one or more atypical observations are
present in the data, the plot of r<sup>*</sup><sub>[<em>m</em>+1]</sub> against the subset size <em>m</em> will show a peak in the
step prior to the inclusion of the first outlier.</p>
<p>Suppose you want to analyze the Hawkins data. </p>
<pre class="programlisting">
% Load Hawkins data: 128 observations and 9 explanatory variables
load hawkins;
% Define y
y=hawkins.data(:,9);
% Define design matrix X
X=hawkins.data(:,1:8);
% Initial starting point based on Least Trimmed Squares
[out]=LXS(y,X,'nsamp',10000);
% Exploratory Forward Search 
[out]=FSReda(y,X,out.bs);
% Monitoring minimum deletion residuals plot
mdrplot(out,'ylimy',[1 8],'xlimx',[25 128])
</pre>
<pre class="programlisting">&nbsp;</pre>
<p>The plot of minimum deletion residual among observations
not in the subset, shows three clear peaks (see Figure below).</p>
<p><img alt="" height="538" src="plots/statistical_visualization_mdr01.jpg" width="676"></p>

<p>
The three
peaks in the figure show the distance of the nearest observation from the
model that has been fitted so far. The first peak is the largest because the
variance of the first 86 cases is so small. The declining shape of each peak
is caused by the increase in s<sup>2</sup> as outliers are introduced during the search,
which reduces the size of the deletion residuals. At the end of the peaks
there is nothing remarkable about the values of the deletion residuals.
This plot is one
way in which the forward search reveals the masked nature of the outliers.

This plots, however, is static in the sense that does not enable for example 
to understand from which units the 3 peaks, which clearly appear in the minimum 
deletion residual plot, are formed. Similarly, it is not clear which 
trajectories of the residuals correspond to the three peaks. So far all this 
information had to be checked manually analyzing the units which entered the 
search. At present, thanks to the interactive connection which we have created 
among the different plots it is possible to select a part of the search in the 
monitoring of the minimum deletion residual using the option <tt>databrush</tt> and 
suboption <tt>persist</tt> and at the same time to see which are the corresponding residuals 
in the monitoring residuals plot and/or the position of the units highlighted in the
scatter plot matrix.</p>
<p>
We initially produce the monitoring residuals plot.</p>
<pre class="programlisting">
resfwdplot(out);
</pre>
<p>
Finally we use the option databrush inside function mdrplot.</p>
<pre class="programlisting">
mdrplot(out,'ylimy',[1 8],'databrush',{'selectionmode','Brush','persist' 'on' 'Label' 'on' 'RemoveLabels' 'off'});
</pre>
<p>
For
example, Figure below shows that the final part of the search which corresponds to the final peak is selected,
it corresponds to the  
most 6 extreme (negative and positive) residuals
enter the last 6 steps of the search.  The plot of y against all explanatory variables shows
that in the scatter of y against X8 these units are those which deviate most from the regression line.
<p><img alt="" height="476" src="plots/statistical_visualization_mdr02.jpg" width="1000"></p>
<p>&nbsp;<p>
</p>

<p>Similarly, if we do a brushing of the steps of the search before the highest 
peak, we can see that all these steps correspond to the set of trajectories
which have a residual very close to 0 in the initial part of the search and when 
the units forming the other groups are introduced their residual is completely 
mixed to that of the other units (see Figure below).
<p><img alt="" height="476" src="plots/statistical_visualization_mdr03.jpg" width="1000"></p>
<p></p>
<p>
In conclusion: every time
a brushing action is performed on the monitoring residuals plot, it is possible
to display in an automatic way also the information about the position of
the brushed units in the scatter diagram of y against the required explanatory
variable(s)
.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Using option <tt>datatooltip</tt> it is also possible to interact with the plot of 
minimum deletion residual. Clicking with the mouse on a point of the curve it is possible to 
have information about the unit selected, the step in which the unit entered the search and the
associated label (if it is present). 
 </p>
<p>For example, using the command</p>
<pre class="programlisting">
 mdrplot(out,'ylimy',[1 8],'datatooltip',1);
 </pre>
 
 if we click on the curve at step <em>m</em>=98 it is&nbsp; possible to know that the value of minimum deletion residual 
is equal to 3.16 and that the unit which will join the subset at step <em>m</em>=99 will be 
the one at row 101.<br>
