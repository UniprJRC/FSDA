        substances. The response is the logarithm of the abundance of a certain
        class of algae. The normal Q-Q plots of the residuals corresponding to
        the LS estimate gives the impression of short-tailed residuals, while

        logaritmic scale (base 10). The temperature is the explanatory
        variable. The dataset is interesting from the statistical point of view
        because contains four strong outliers (observations 11, 20, 30, and
        34), correponding to giant stars, which affect the OLS regression
        parameters. Robustness aspects linked to this dataset are discussed in
        Rousseeuw and Leroy (1987, p. 27).</span></td>

        yarn in a 3<sup>3</sup> experiment (Box and Cox, 1964). The wool data
        give the number of cycles to failure of a worsted yarn under cycles of
        repeated loading. The results are from a single 3<sup>3</sup> factorial
        experiment. The three factors and their levels are: <br>
        - x1: length of test specimen (25, 30, 35 cm) <br>
        - x2: amplitude of loading cycle (8, 9, 10 mm) <br>
        - x3: load (40, 45, 50 g). <br>
        The number of cycles to failure ranges from 90, for the shortest
        specimen subject to the most severe conditions, to 3,636 for
        observation 19 which comes from the longest specimen subjected to the
        mildest conditions. In their analysis Box and Cox(1964) recommend that
        the data be fitted after the log transformation of y. The FS plots
        explain the effect of the ordering of the data during the FS on the
        estimates of regression coefficients and the error variance and on a
        score statistic for transformation of the response.</td>
