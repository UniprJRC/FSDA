<h2 class="title">MCD estimators</h2>


<p>The MCD estimator works as follows:</p>
<p>Fix an integer h such that $[(n+v+1)/2] \leq h < n$ where $[ \; ]$ denotes the integer part. The preferred choice of $h$ for outlier detection is its lower
bound, which yields the breakdown value $[(n+v+1)/2]/n$. Let $\hat \mu_{MCD}$ and $\hat \Sigma_{MCD}$
be the mean and the covariance matrix of the subset of $h$ observations for
which the determinant of the covariance matrix is minimal. $\hat \mu_{MCD}$ is defined to be the MCD
estimator of $\mu$, whereas the MCD estimator of $\Sigma$ is proportional to $\hat \Sigma_{MCD}$.</p>
<p>
The proportionality
constant is chosen to achieve consistency at the normal model. It was derived by Butler et al.
(1993) and by Croux and Haesbroeck (1999) as</p>
$$c_{MCD}(h,n,v)=\frac{h/n}{P\Big(X_{v+2}^2 < \chi_{v,h/n}^2 \Big)} $$


<p>The MCD is used because it has rate of convergence $n^{−0.5}$, unlike the minimum
volume ellipsoid estimator (Davies, 1992) for which convergence is at rate $n^{-1/3}$. Another reason
is the fast algorithm of Rousseeuw and Van Driessen (1999), which has been 
implemented in many languages. </p>
<p>Although consistent at the normal model, the estimator</p>
$$ c_{MCD}(h,n,v)\hat \Sigma_{MCD} $$
</p>
is still biased for small sample sizes in the sense that the empirical size is 
much greater than the nominal one. Pison et al. (2002) showed by Monte Carlo simulation the
importance of applying a small sample correction factor to it to achieve an 
empirical size much closer to the nominal. Let $s_{MCD}(h,n,v)$
be this factor
for a specific choice of $n$ and $v$. The resulting (squared) robust
Mahalanobis distances are then
$$  d_{(MCD)i}^2=k_{MCD}(y_i-\hat \mu_{MCD})^T \hat \Sigma_{MCD}^{-1}(y_i-\hat \mu_{MCD}),  \quad \quad \quad i=1, \dots,n,$$
</p>
where $k_{MCD}=\{c_{MCD}(h,n,v) \; s_{MCD}(h,n,v) \}^{-1}$. These distances are compared with the $\alpha\%$ cutoff
value of their asymptotic $\chi^2$ distribution with $v$ degrees of freedom, with $\alpha$ in most published reports between 0.01
and 0.05.
<p></p>
<p>The exact finite sample distribution of the robust Mahalanobis distances 
analyzed above is unknown, but
Hardin and Rocke (2005) proposed a scaled F-approximation which, in small and moderate
samples, outperforms the asymptotic $\chi_v^2$ distribution 
 approximation of MCD</p>
<p>To increase efficiency, a reweighted version of the MCD estimators is often used in practice.
These reweighted estimators, $\hat \mu_{RMCD}$ and $\hat \Sigma_{RMCD}$  are computed by giving weight 0 to observations
for which $d_{(MCD)i}$  exceeds a cut-off value. Thus a first subset of $h$ observations is used
to select a second subset from which the parameters are estimated. The default choice for this
cut-off is</p>
$$ \surd \chi_{v,0.025}^2 \times $$

<p>Both the consistency (Croux and Haesbroeck, 2000) and the small sample (Pison et al., 2002)
correction factors $c_{RMCD}(h,n,v) $ and $s_{RMCD}(h,n,v) $  
can be applied to $\hat \Sigma_{RMCD}$ when the squared
robust Mahalanobis distances become</p>
$$ d_{(RMCD-C)i}^2=k_{RMCD-C}(y_i-\hat \mu_{RMCD})^T \hat \Sigma_{RMCD}^{-1}(y_i-\hat \mu_{RMCD}), \quad \quad \quad i=1,\dots,n,$$
with $k_{RMCD-C}=\{c_{RMCD}(h,n,v) \; s_{RMCD}(h,n,v) \}^{-1}  $. The reweighted distances are again compared
with their asymptotic $\chi_v^2$-distribution (Lopuhaä, 1999).</p>

<h3>Example 1</h3>
<p>The code below loads the <a href="datasets_mv.html">heads dataset</a> and launch the 
MCD outlier detection procedure</p>
<pre class="programlisting">
% Load the data
load('head');
Y=head.data;
% Use function FSM (Forward search in multivariate analysis with automatic outlier detection purposes)
[RAW,REW]=mcd(Y,'plots',1,'conflev',1-0.01/size(Y,1));
</pre>
<p>No outlier is declared using the Bonferroni threshold using raw or 
reweuighted mcd.</p>

<p>
<h3>Example 2</h3>
<p>The code below loads the <a href="datasets_mv.html">mussels dataset</a> and 
performs an automatic outlier detection procedure 
in the original scale and then in the BoxCox transformed scale.</p>
Analysis on the original scale
<pre class="programlisting">
load('mussels.mat');
Y=mussels.data;
[RAW,REW]=mcd(Y,'plots',1,'conflev',1-0.01/size(Y,1));
</pre>
<p>
<img alt="" src="images_help/mult_mcd02.jpg"></p>
<p>&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
The associated scatter plot matrices with the outliers highlighted, which are 
produced atuomatically are shown below.</p>
<p>
<img alt="" src="images_help/mult_mcd03.jpg"></p>
&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;
</p>

<p>
The analysis on the transformed scale is shown below
<pre class="programlisting">
load('mussels.mat');
Y=mussels.data;
la=[0.5 0 0.5 0 0];
v=size(Y,2);
Y=normBoxCox(Y,1:v,la);
[RAW,REW]=mcd(Y,'plots',1,'conflev&#39;,1-0.01/size(Y,1))</pre>

<br><br>
<img alt="" src="images_help/mult_mcd04.jpg"><p>&nbsp;
</p>
<p>The raw MCD seems to declare 6 outliers while the reweighted MCD finds just 4.</p>
You can compare this output with that which 
comes out from the use of <a href="mult_sandmm.html">S and MM estimators</a> or those based on the 
<a href="mult_fsm.html">forward search</a>.</p>
