	<h2 id="bqvsgfl-1" class="title">Forward search in multivariate analysis with exploratory data analysis 
(EDA) purposes</h2>
<p class="purpose">Forward search in multivariate analysis used for exploratory data 
analysis (EDA) purposes 
 monitors the evolution of Mahalanobis distances, elements of the covariance 
matrix..., as the subset size increases. In other words, the results are 
presented as “forward plots” which show the evolution of the quantities of 
interest as a function of subset size. Therefore, unlike other robust 
approaches, the forward search is a dynamic process that produces a sequence of 
estimates and related plots. 


</p>
<p class="purpose">If there are outliers they will
have large distances during the early part of the search that
decrease dramatically at the end as the outlying observations are
included in the subset of observations used for parameter
estimation.

If our interest is in outlier
detection we can also monitor, for example,  the
minimum Mahalanobis distance among units not in the subset.
If an outlier is about to enter, this distance will be large,
although it will decrease again as the search progresses if a
cluster of outliers join.

If there are two clusters of roughly equal size and we start with units from one 
of them, the units in the other cluster will all be remote and have large 
distances until they start to join the subset half way through the search.

</p>
<p class="purpose">In this page in order to illustrate how the 
forward search works we analyzie the <a href="datasets_mv.html">swiss bank-note dataset.</a> This example 
emphasizes the way in which the search can be used to explore the structure of 
the data. It also highlights the importance of flexibility in the choice of 
starting point.  </p>
<p class="purpose">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="purpose">We start by monitoring the Mahalanobis 
distances. </p>

<pre class="programlisting">
load('swiss_banknotes');
Y=swiss_banknotes.data;
[fre]=unibiv(Y);
fre=sortrows(fre,[3 4]);
bs=fre(1:size(Y,2)+5,1);
[out]=FSMeda(Y,bs,'init',30,'scaled',1);
fground=struct;
fground.flabstep='';
malfwdplot(out,'fground',fground);
</pre>

<p>
 This plot suggests there are about 20 outliers, but there is indeed no obvious indication of two groups. 
 </p>
 
<p class="purpose">

<p class="purpose">&nbsp;</p>

<p>
Now we start with units in
Group 1 (genuine notes) and see what happens to the forward plot of
 scaled Mahalanobis distances.
</p>


<pre class="programlisting">
load('swiss_banknotes');
Y=swiss_banknotes.data;
% start in the group of genuine notes
bs=1:20;
[out]=FSMeda(Y,bs,'init',30,'scaled',1);
malfwdplot(out);
</pre>
<p>
In the first part of the search, up to $m= 93$,
the observations seem to
 fall into two groups. One has small distances and is composed of
observations within or shortly to join the subset. Above these
there are some outliers and then, higher still, a concentrated
band of outliers, all of which are behaving similarly.


When m=101 the search has reached a point at which at least one
observation from Group 2 has to joint the subset. In fact, as the
figure shows, due to the presence of outliers, this inclusion of
units from both groups starts a little earlier. From $m=95$ the
distances to the group of outliers decrease rapidly, as remote
observations from Group 1, the genuine notes, join the subset.
Around $m=105$ we can see that many of these former outliers are
joining the subset (their distances decrease), while many of the
units formerly in the subset leave (their distances increase). The
crossing of two bands of outliers, seen here between $m=105$ and $m=115$, is typical of distances in a forward search when one
multivariate normal distribution is fitted to data that contain
two or more groups of appreciable size. Once the subset contains
units from both groups, the search continues in a way similar and
then identical to that of the earlier search. The right hand
thirds of these two figures show identical
patterns of Mahalanobis distances, the only difference being the
vertical scale of the plots.</p>

<p>
We now start with units in
Group 2 (the forgeries).
</p>


<pre class="programlisting">
load('swiss_banknotes');
Y=swiss_banknotes.data;
[fre]=unibiv(Y);
fre=sortrows(fre,[3 4]);
bs=fre(1:size(Y,2)+5,1);
[out]=FSMeda(Y,bs,'init',30,'scaled',1);
malfwdplot(out);
</pre>

<p>The forward plot of
scaled Mahalanobis distances&nbsp; is broadly
similar to that when we started with Group 1 (genuine notes), 
but the differences are informative. Before the interchange of units in the 
subset, the two groups seem more clearly separated than when we started from 
Group 1, although the non-fitted observations have a higher dispersion than 
before. The interchange starts earlier, because some units in Group 1 are closer 
to the centre of Group 2 than some of the outliers from Group 2. The distances 
for these outliers appear unaffected by the change in subset. The last third of the search is again the
same as before.

Finally we want to stress that with our personalized datatooltip clicking on a 
line it is possible to have a series of information about the selected 
trajectory (see yello box in the figure above).</p>
