<h1 style="text-align: justify;">The FSDA group: milestones and synergies<br />
</h1>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
<h2>The group ...<br />
</h2>
The core of the FSDA group comes both from the members of
the division of Statistics and Computing of the <span style="color: rgb(51, 102, 255);">University of Parma</span> and
the
Department of Statistics of the <span style="color: rgb(51, 102, 255);">London School of Economics</span> (from now on
ParmaLSE) made up of Anthony Atkinson (LSE), Marco Riani and Andrea
Cerioli
(Parma). This has resulted in the publication of two books with
Springer-Verlag New York (Atkinson and Riani, 2000; Atkinson Riani and
Cerioli,
2004) and many papers in prestigious international journals. The last
20 years
of joint research of people from ParmaLSE and their research partners can be summarized as follows:
</div>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>1994-2002.</strong> Introduction of the new approach 
based on the forward search. At
that time
we were completely unaware of many of the potentialities of the new
approach
and we did not think of it as a new philosophy. The emphasis was as a
new
technique of exploratory data analysis in linear and nonlinear
regression and
generalized linear models. In the case of a single population and
contaminated
data, the new approach revealed itself as a powerful tool for detecting
the
presence of outliers, both individual and grouped, and to evaluate
their effect
on the results of traditional analyses (Riani and Atkinson, 2000). </p>
<div style="text-align: justify;">

</div>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>2002-2004.</strong> Extension of this technique to the
analysis of
multivariate data based on a combination of statistical modelling and
graphical
diagnostics. 
 In these years we also realized the importance of monitoring 
statistics and developed diagnostic tools specifically based on these monitoring 
plots. Our "monitoring philosophy" started in these years.</p>
<div style="text-align: justify;">

</div>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>2005-2008. </strong> In this period we began to introduce
the Forward
Search not only as an exploratory tool but also for inferential
purposes and we
have developed a theory for the construction of robust confidence bands
for the
curves which are monitored along the search. This work laid to the
foundation for the automatic
application of the procedure in multivariate analysis (Riani et al.
2009). Clearly, the automation of the procedure is necessary in
concrete applications where the Forward Search has to be repeated many
times. One of the objectives of the team is to extend this automated
procedure to multiple regression or, more generally, to the analysis of
complex data. The first step in this direction can be found in Riani et
al. (2008).</p>
<div style="text-align: justify;">

</div>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>2005. </strong>Well before the FSDA toolbox, an
implementation of the Forward Search was done in Splus and R by Dr.
Konis for the analysis of multivariate data (e.g. the Rfwdmd software
downloadable from the CRAN site). Unfortunately, lack of resources
prevented the maintenance of such implementations. Almost ten years
later, Luca Scrucca revitalized the package ‘forward’. </p>
<div style="text-align: justify;">

</div>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>2008. 
</strong> The need to apply routinely the
Forward Search and robust methods to huge amounts of international
trade data and related antifraud problems encouraged a new
collaboration between the ParmaLSE team and the <span style="color: rgb(51, 102, 255);">European Commission's
Joint Research Centre</span>. The persons originally involved in this project
at the JRC were
Domenico Perrotta, Francesca Torti (working for several years also for
the University of Parma), Vytis Kopustinskas and the head of the group,
Spyros Arsenis. The joint activities of the two teams progressed till
today with always-new stimuli and challenging problems. 
 The FSDA
toolbox is one of the main outcomes of this collaboration. </p>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
</div>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>2010</strong>. We started including in the toolbox all traditional 
robust estimators (S, MM and tau) with the different weight functions (Hampel, 
hyperbolic, optimal and biweght) together with high breakdown estimators (LMS, 
LTS, MVE and MCD) and their reweighted version. We have also implemented the 
accurate distributional approximations to the finite sample distribution of the 
corresponding diagnostic tools (Cerioli Riani and Atkinson, 2009; Cerioli, 
2010). In this FSDA became a general tool for robust data analysis (regression 
and multivariate) and even changed its name in "<span style="font-style: italic;">Flexible Statistics and Data 
Analysis toolbox</span>".</p>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
</div>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong style="font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">2014</span>. </strong>The  concept ot monitoring was applied to the 
traditional robust estimators (such as S, MM and tau) and to high breakdown 
estimators based on trimming both in the regression (such as LTS and LMS) and multivariate context (e.g. MVE, MVD).  </p>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
</div>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">2015.</span> The main robust clustering methods were introduced into 
the toolbox: tclust, tkmeans, rlga, and the non-robust counterpart lga. One
year later the set of robust clustering tools was enriched with
clusterwise regression methods (tclust-reg) and cluster weighted models
(tcwrm). For these last extensions we could benefit from the precious
help of Agustín Mayo-Iscar.</p>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
</div>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="font-weight: bold;">2016</span></strong>. We have always given special
importance to the role of simulations and benchmark experiments in the
statistical practice. 
 For this reason we introduced in FSDA sound
methods for generating mixtures of populations based on user-specified overlap: MixSim and MixSimReg. The
project (quite demanding) could benefit from precious interactions with
Volodymyr Melnykov, had at the Model-Based Clustering workshop series
organised in Catania by Salvatore Ingrassia.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">2017</span>.
We released FSDA with a new documentation system, generated
automatically from the head of the .m files. The "documentation
project" started at least two year before, and could see the light only
in 2017. The project goes on: the
ambition is to make our documentation tools friendly enough to be
usable by any user who wants to do the same with his/her toolbox. 
<strong> </strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">2019</span>.
We ported the versioning system of the FSDA to github. 
<strong> </strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"> 
</p>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
<strong><br />

</strong></div>
<h2><strong>... and its synergies<br />
</strong></h2>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The ParmaLSE - JRC teams created in the last years lot of synergies
with new research groups, extending considerably the network of
scientists interested in (robust) solutions to anti-fraud problems and
in the Forward Search as an original approach for data analysis. With
apologies for possible involuntary omissions, we mention here some of them.</p>

<div style="text-align: justify;">

</div>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">2009</span>. Fruitful contacts
were established with the University of Rome La Sapienza (Pierluigi
Conti and Alessio Farcomeni) in view of grounding the Forward Search in
the theory of empirical processes. The objective is to find the
limiting trajectories to which the curves monitored in the Forward
Search might converge. 
</p>
<div style="text-align: justify;">

</div>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">2009</span>. Collaboration
with the University of Verona (Grossi and Laurini, 2009) produced
extensions of the new philosophy to the analysis of correlated
observations and more specifically to the context of extreme value
theory.</p>
<div style="text-align: justify;">

</div>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">2010</span>. New studies on the
Forward Search philosophy were initiated by PhD students (now
integrated in the Parma team) in topics such as "The forward search in
Bayesian statistics (Aldo Corbellini)" and "Robust classification and
mixtures (Gianluca Morelli)". </p>
<div style="text-align: justify;">

</div>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">2011</span>. Fruitful
collaboration started with the robust clustering group of the
University of Valladolid (Carlos Matran, Alfonso Gordaliza, Agustín
Mayo-Iscar, Carlos Matrán, Luis Angel García-Escudero), with regular
meetings organised in Ispra, Parma and Valladolid. The link between the
Valladolid group was naturally established, because of the close
relation between their trimming approach (considered e.g. in
García-Escudero and
Gordaliza, 2007) and the Forward Search. Relevant outcomes of the
collaboration include methodological studies (e.g. on the determination
of the number of groups in TCLUST), applications of TCLUST and RLGA in
antifraud, 
 and new FSDA functions for trimmed based clustering
methods, including tools for the generation of simulated clustering
data based on prespecified level of overlap (MixSim). 
</p>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
</div>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">2012</span>. FSDA routines have been 
adopted by ISTAT, the Italian National Institute of Statistics, 
 for the 
correction and control of Italian Agriculture Census data (Reale, Bianchi,
<span class="st">Francescangeli Ruocco and <span>Manzari, ISTAT</span>).</span> 
 <br />

 </p>
<div style="text-align: justify;">

</div>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">2013-2014</span>. This may
become an important milestone, because we are convinced that the lack
of good statistical software is a main factor limiting the diffusion of
the new philosophy and robust statistics in general. The milestone is
about the porting of the main FSDA Forward Search functions to SAS IML
and SAS IML Studio. The work, initiated in 2008 by the JRC trainee
Tomas Demcenko, was revitalized and finalized in the JRC by Francesca
Torti in collaboration with staff from SAS: Koen Knapen and Jos
Polfliet. With the porting, now the Forward Search can be run in the
SAS platform for both inferential and exploratory data analysis
purposes, including several of the interactive and dynamic plotting
features that characterize FSDA.</p>
<div style="text-align: justify;">

</div>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">2013-2015</span>. A second
factor potentially limiting the diffusion of the new philosophy was the
lack of sound asymptotic theory for the Forward Search monitoring
process. Johansen and Nielsen (2013, 2014), starting from several
meetings held with the ParmaLSE team, developed respectively pointwise
and simultaneous confidence bands for estimators and forward residuals.
Nielsen also implemented the undelying asymptotic theory in 
 the
`ForwardSearch' R package.</p>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
</div>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">2017</span>.
FSDA team started collaborating with Valentin Todorov on the porting of
the key FSDA regression routines to a R package. 
 </p>
<div style="text-align: justify;">


</div>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It is worthwhile to mention other people who share the same
philosophy, who
have been in contact from time to time with the “ParmaLSE team” and who
have already given important theoretical and applied contributions to
the
forward search literature. For example, Fabio Crosilla of the
University of
Udine has extended the forward routines to data on photogrammetry. This
extension has considerably improved the classification of spatial
objects. Nadia Solaro is currently working to extend
this new
philosophy to multilevel models. Daniela Calò
has
investigated the use of forward search routines for finding groups of
homogeneous observations in the context of robust cluster analysis. Silvia Salini has recently worked on robust extensions of
calibration
models using forward search tools. Matilde Bini has used
the
forward search to develop robust transformations in percentage data
while Bruno Bertaccini, together with Roberta Varriale, has extended the new 
philosophy to the robust analysis of variance. Moustaki and Mavridis extended 
the forward serach approach to perform robust factor analysis. Recently, C. 
Chakraborty and S. S. Dhar extended the asymtptic theory monitoring approach to 
elliptical distributions, while M. Baragilly created new tools for assessing the 
number of clusters based on the idea of monitoring in presence of non elliptical 
distributions.</p>
<div style="text-align: justify;">


</div>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We finally hope further interaction with researchers who use approaches based 
on dynamic models which show strong points of contact with our philosophy.</p>
<div style="text-align: justify;">


</div>

<p style="text-align: justify;">In summary, it is true to say that the growth of the Forward Search
method
into a philosophy and practical approach of data analysis is largely
due to the
initiative and leadership of Anthony Atkinson, Marco Riani and Andrea
Cerioli
who, when the method was introduced, had the capacity to move the
research well
beyond the then understood scientific boundaries. However, we also
believe that
the success of this philosophy of data analysis relies on a wider
combination
of circumstances and people, including:<br />

</div>
<ul style="text-align: justify;">

  </ul>
<ul style="text-align: justify;">
  <li>
    <p>Sound management of all steps of software documentation,
development, testing and packaging. These tasks now involve several staff
members from both Parma and 
 JRC, in particular: Emmanulele
Sordini, Patrizia Calcaterra, Aldo Corbellini, Gianluca Morelli. 
</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Automatic and regular testing of all FSDA functions over multiple MATLAB platforms, from 2009b on.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Beta testing carried out by intensive FSDA users (we thank in particular Andrea Cerasa and Andrea Pagano).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Informal but regular interactions with Mathworks staff, both in
Italy and US (Francesca Perino and Deve Bergstein, in particular).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Cultivate and create space for fresh ideas. Young researchers at
doctoral and post-doctoral level will be always more than welcome. New

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A stable practical laboratory for the assessment of our
theoretical foundations, providing a considerable number of
applications to real data affected by different sources of

interaction between theoretical understanding and practical exploration
can ensure advancement towards our objectives. </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Spread the new methodology to different fields of application and
at the same time extend the procedure theoretically and empirically to
the new problems which arise from the different contexts (Statistics
and engineering group).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Interact with scientists from the robust statistics community in
order to understand how some recent proposals (i.e. those based on
robust adaptive estimators and the weighted likelihood approach) can be
