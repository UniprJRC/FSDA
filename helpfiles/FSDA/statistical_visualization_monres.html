<a class="indexterm" name="zmw57dd0e2698"></a>
<p></p>
<p>A monitoring residual plot is the plot which monitors all residuals at each step of the
forward search. Large values of the residuals among cases not in the subset
indicate the presence of outliers, as do non-smooth changes in the value of the 
residuals.</p>
<p>Suppose you want to analyze the Hawkins data. </p>
<pre class="programlisting">
% Load Hawkins data: 128 observations and 9 explanatory variables
load hawkins;
% Define y
y=hawkins.data(:,9);
% Define design matrix X
X=hawkins.data(:,1:8);
% Initial starting point based on Least Trimmed Squares
[out]=LXS(y,X,'nsamp',10000);
% Exploratory Forward Search 
[out]=FSReda(y,X,out.bs);
% Monitoring residuals plot
resfwdplot(out)
% Monitoring minimum deletion residuals plot
mdrplot(out,'ylimy',[1 8],'xlimx',[25 128])
</pre>
<pre class="programlisting">&nbsp;</pre>
<p>The plot of minimum deletion residual among observations
not in the subset, shows three clear peaks (see Figure below) </p>
<p><img alt="" height="538" src="plots/statistical_visualization_monres01.jpg" width="676"></p>
<p>The monitoring of scaled residuals clearly shows that there
is a lot of interchange in the order of magnitude of the residuals during the
forward search.</p>
<pre class="programlisting">
resfwdplot(out)
</pre>
<p>
<img height="348" src="plots/statistical_visualization_monres02.jpg" width="676"></p>
<p>These plots are static in the sense that do not enable for example 
to understand from which units the 3 peaks, which clearly appear in the minimum 
deletion residual plot, are formed. Similarly, it is not clear which 
trajectories of the residuals correspond to the three peaks. So far all this 
information had to be checked manually analyzing the units which entered the 
search. At present, thanks to the interactive connection which we have created 
among the different plots it is possible to select a set of trajectories in the 
monitoring residuals plot and at the same time to see them highlighted in the 
monitoring of the minimum deletion residual using the option <tt>databrush</tt> and 
sub option <tt>persist</tt>.</p>
<pre class="programlisting">
databrush=struct;
databrush.selectionmode='Brush'; % Brush selection
databrush.persist='on'; % Enable repeated mouse selections
resfwdplot(out,'databrush',databrush);</pre>
<p>For
example, the Figure below shows that the most extreme (negative and positive) residuals
enter the last 6 steps of the search and are associated with the final peak.
<p><img alt="" height="374" src="plots/statistical_visualization_monres03.jpg" width="820"></p>
<p>&nbsp;<p>
</p>

<p>Similarly, if we do a second brushing, we can see that the set of trajectories
selected in the left hand panel of Figure below correspond to units which enter
consecutively and are associated with the second peak in the right panel of
the Figure below.
<p><img alt="" height="374" src="plots/h3.jpg" width="820"></p>
<p></p><p></p>
<p>The figure below shows the output of a third additional brushing which 
is connected
with the first peak in the minimum deletion residual plot.</p>
<img alt="" height="380" src="plots/h4.jpg" width="820">
<p></p>
<p>
Every time
a brushing action is performed on the monitoring residuals plot, it is possible
to display in an automatic way also the information about the position of
the brushed units in the scatter diagram of y against the required explanatory
variable(s)
</p>
<p>For example, the commands below</p>
<pre class="programlisting">
databrush=struct;
databrush.bivarfit='2'; 
databrush.selectionmode='Brush'; % Brush selection
databrush.persist='on'; % Enable repeated mouse selections
resfwdplot(out,'databrush',databrush);
</pre>
once a set of trajectories in the monitoring residuals plot 
is brushed,
enables the user to superimpose in the scatter plot matrix, which 
opens automatically, the projected regression line with and without the brushed units. 
Finally, in the command window, it is also possible to have the information 
about the units which are brushed and their order of entry into the forward 
procedure.
