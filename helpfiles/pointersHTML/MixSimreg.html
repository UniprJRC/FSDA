  Notation and background.

  Given two generic clusters $i$ and $j$ with $i \ne j=1,...,k$, indexed by
  $\phi(x,\mu_i,\sigma_i^2)$ and $\phi(x,\mu_j, \sigma_j^2)$ with probabilities of
  occurrence $\pi_i$ and $\pi_j$, the misclassification probability with
  respect to cluster $i$ (denoted with $w_{j|i}$) is defined as 
  \[ 
   Pr[\pi_i \phi(x,\mu_i,\sigma_i^2) &lt; \pi_j \phi(x,\mu_j,\sigma_j^2)] 
   \]
  where, in the regression context, $\mu_i={\overline x}_i' \beta_i$ and
  $\mu_j= \overline x_j' \beta_j$. We assume that the length of vectors $x_i$,
  $x_j$, $\beta_i$, and $\beta_j$ is $p$ (number of explanatory variables
  including or excluding intercept). In our implementation, the
  distribution of the elements of vectors $\beta_i$ ($\beta_j$) can be 'Normal'
  (with parameters $\mu$ and $\sigma$), 'HalfNormal' (with parameter $\sigma$) or
  uniform (with parameters $a$ and $b$). Same thing for the distribution of
  the elements of $x_i$ ($x_j$). However, while the parameters of the
  distributions are the same for all elements of $\beta$ in all groups, the
  parameters of the distribution of the elements of vectors $x_i$ ($x_j$) can
  vary for each group and each explanatory variable. In other words, it is
  possible to specify (say) that the distribution of the second
  explanatory variable in the first group is $U(2, 3)$ while the distribution
  of the third explanatory variable in the second group is $U(2, 10)$.

  The matrix containing the misclassification probabilities $w_{j|i}$ is
  called OmegaMap.
  The probability of overlapping between groups i and j is given by
      \[      w_{j|i} + w_{i|j}    \qquad       i,j=1,2, ..., k      \]
  The diagonal elements of OmegaMap are equal to 1.
  The average overlap (BarOmega, in the code) is defined as the sum of the
  off diagonal elements of OmegaMap (containing the misclassification
  probabilities) divided by $k*(k-1)/2$.
  The maximum overlap (MaxOmega, in the code) is defined as:
     \[       \max (w_{j|i} + w_{i|j})  \qquad i \ne j=1,2, ..., k   \]

  The probability of overlapping $w_{j|i}$ is nothing but the cdf of a linear
  combination of non central $\chi^2$ distributions with 1 degree of freedom
  plus a linear combination of $N(0,1)$ evaluated in a point $c$.
  The coefficients of the linear combinations of non central $\chi^2$ and
  $N(0,1)$ and point c depend on 
  $\sigma_{j|i}^2 = \sigma_i^2/\sigma_j^2$.
  This probability is computed using routine ncx2mixtcdf</P><h2>References</h2><P>Maitra, R. and Melnykov, V. (2010), Simulating data to study performance
