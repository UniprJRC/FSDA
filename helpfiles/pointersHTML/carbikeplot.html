   a structure containing the best relevant solutions) and produces the
   car-bike plot. This plot provides a concise summary of the best
   relevant solutions. This plot shows on the horizontal axis the value of
   $c$ restriction factor (or $\alpha$ trimming level) and on the vertical
   axis the value of $k$. For each solution we draw a rectangle for the
   interval of values for which the solution is best and stable and a
   horizontal line which departs from the rectangle for the values of $c$
   in which the solution is only stable. Finally, for the best value of
   $c$ ($\alpha$)associated to the solution, we show a circle with two
   numbers, the first number indicates the ranked solution among those
   which are not spurious and the second one the ranked number including
   the spurious solutions. This plot has been baptized ``car-bike'',
   because the first best solutions (in general 2 or 3) are generally best
   and stable for a large number of values of $c$ and therefore will have
   large rectangles. In addition, these solutions are likely to be stable
   for additional values of $c$ ($\alpha$) and therefore are likely to
   have horizontal lines departing from the rectangles (from here the name
   ``cars''). Finally, local minor solutions (which are associated with
   particular values of $c$ ($\alpha$) and $k$) do not generally present
   rectangles or lines and are shown with circles (from here the name
   ``bikes'')</P><h2>References</h2><P>Cerioli, A. Garcia-Escudero, L.A., Mayo-Iscar, A. and Riani, M. (2017),
