   a structure containing the best relevant solutions) and produces the
   car-bike plot. This plot provides a concise summary of the best
   relevant solutions. This plot shows on the horizontal axis the value of
   $c$ and on the vertical axis the value of $k$. For each solution we
   draw a rectangle for the interval of values for which the solution is
   best and stable and a horizontal line which departs from the rectangle
   for the values of $c$ in which the solution is only stable. Finally,
   for the best value of $c$ associated to the solution, we show a circle
   with two numbers, the first number indicates the ranked solution among
   those which are not spurious and the second one the ranked number
   including the spurious solutions. This plot has been baptized
   ``car-bike'', because the first best solutions (in general 2 or 3) are
   generally best and stable for a large number of values of $c$ and
   therefore will have large rectangles. In addition, these solutions are
   likely to be stable for additional values of $c$ and therefore are
   likely to have horizontal lines departing from the rectangles (from
   here the name ``cars''). Finally, local minor solutions (which are
   associated with particular values of $c$ and $k$) do not generally
   present rectangles or lines and are shown with circles (from here the
   name ``bikes'')</P><h2>More About</h2><P></P><h2>References</h2><P>A. Cerioli, L.A. Garcia-Escudero, A. Mayo-Iscar and M. Riani (2017),
