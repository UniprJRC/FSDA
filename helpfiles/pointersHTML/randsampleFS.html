   The method=0 uses MATLAB function randperm. In old MATLAB releases
   randperm was slower than FSDA function shuffling, which is used in
   method 1 (for example, in R2009a - MATLAB 7.8 - randperm was at least
   50 slower).  

   If method=1 the approach depends on the population and sample sizes:
   - if $n &lt; 1000$ and $k &lt; n/(10 + 0.007n)$, that is if the population is
     relatively small and the desired sample is small compared to the
     population, we repeatedly sample with replacement until there are k
     unique values;
   - otherwise, we do a random permutation of the population and return  
     the first k elements. 
   The threshold $k &lt; n/(10 + 0.007n)$ has been determined by simulation
   under MATLAB R2016b. Before, the threshold was $n &lt; 4*k$.

   If method=2 systematic sampling is used, where the starting point is
   random and the step is also random. 

   If method=3 random sampling is based on the old but well known Linear
   Congruential Generator (LCG) method. In this case there is no guarantee
   to get unique numbers. The method is included for historical reasons.

   If method is a vector of n weights, then Weighted Sampling Without
   Replacement is applied. Our implementation follows Efraimidis and
   Spirakis (2006). MATLAB function datasample follows Wong and  Easton
   (1980), which is also quite fast; note however that function datasample
   may be very slow if applied repetedly, for the large amount of time
   spent on options checking.

   Remark on computation performances. Method=2 (systematic sampling) is
   by far the fastest for any practical population size $n$. For example,
   for $n \approx 10^6$ method=2 is two orders of magniture faster than
   method=1. With recent MATLAB releases (after R2011b) method = 0 (which
   uses compiled MATLAB function randperm) has comparable performances, at
   least for reasonably small $k$. In releases before 2012a, randperm was
   considerably slow.
