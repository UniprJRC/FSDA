 are equal. Note that Box test is sensitive to departures from
 normality. If the samples come from non-normal distributions, then Box
 test may simply be testing for non-normality.</P><h2>More About</h2><P>
 We assume independent samples of size $n_1$, $n_2$, $\ldots$,
 $n_g$ from a $v$-multivariate normal distribution. The hypothesis of
 equality of covariances is:
 
 \[
 H_0= \Sigma_1 = \Sigma_2 = \ldots = \Sigma_g
 \]

 To make the test we calculate:
 
 \[
 M=\frac{ |S_1|^{n_1-1} |S_2|^{n_2-1} \ldots |S_g|^{n_g-1} }{|S_{pl}|^{\sum_{i=1}^g n_i-1} }
 \]

 where $S_i$ is the covariance matrix of group $i$ and $S_{pl}$ is the
 pooled sample covariance matrix. It is clear that we must have $n_i-1&gt;v$
 otherwise $|S_i|=0$ for some $i$ and $M$ would be zero. The statistic $M$
 is a modification of the likelihood ratio test and varies between 0 and 1
 with values near 1 favouring $H_0$ and values near 0 leading to the
 rejection of $H_0$ (see Rencher (2002) p. 256 for further details). The
 quantity $-2 \ln M$ is approximately distributed as a $\chi^2$
 distribution and is given in $\mbox{out.LR}$.  The quantity $-2(1-c_1) \ln  M$
 (where $c_1$ is a small sample correction factor) is usually called
 correct Box test and is approximately distributed as a $\chi^2$ with $0.5
 (g-1) v(v+1)$ degrees of freedom. We reject $H_0$ if 
 $$-2(1-c_1) \ln M  &gt;\chi^2_{1-\alpha}$$ where $\chi^2_{1-\alpha}$ is the 
 $1-\alpha$ quantile. The value of this test is contained in
 $\mbox{out.LRchi2approx}$  and the corresponding p-value of this test is
 given in $\mbox{out.LRchi2approx_pval}$.
 Box also derived and F approximation to the test. This test is computed
 just if input option Fapprox is true. The value of this last test and the
 corresponding p-values are given in $\mbox{out.LRFapprox}$ and
 $\mbox{LRFapprox_pval}$.
 WARNING: if the absolute value of the determinant of the
 covariance matrix of any group is less than 1e-40,
 a missing value for LR test is reported.
