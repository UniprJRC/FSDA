  Computational issues to be addressed in future releases.
  [1]
  FSDA function "wthin" uses the MATLAB function ksdensity. The calls to
  ksdensity have been optimized. The only possibility to further reduce
  time execution is to replace ksdensity with a more efficient kernel
  density estimator.
  [2]
  The weighted version of tclustreg requires weighted sampling. This is
  now implemented in randsampleFS. A computaionally more efficient
  algorithm, based on a binary tree approach introduced by
      Wong, C.K. and M.C. Easton (1980) "An Efficient Method for Weighted
      Sampling Without Replacement", SIAM Journal of Computing,
      9(1):111-113.
  is provided by recent releases of the MATLAB function datasample.
  Unfortunately this function spends most of the self running time useless
  parameter checking. To copy the function in the FSDA folder
  FSDA/combinatorial, possibly rename it, and remove the option parameters
  checks, is not sufficient, as datasample relies on a mex file wswor
  which is platform dependent. The issue is usually referred to as "code
  signature".
  [3]
  In the plots, the use of text to highlight the groups with their index
  is terribly slow (more than 10 seconds to generate a scatter of 7000
  units. ClickableMultiLegend and legend are also slow.
  [4]
  FSDA function restreigen could be improved. In some cases it is one of
  the most expensive functions.

 REMARK: trimming vs thinning
 - trimming is the key feature of TCLUST, giving robustness to the model.
 - thinning is a new denoising feature introduced to mitigate the
   distorting effect of very dense data areas. It is implemented via
   observation weighting.
 For the sake of code readability, the relevant sections of the code are
 identified with a "TRIMMING" or "THINNING" tag.

 REMARK: the number of parameters to penalize the likelihood are given
 below:
 $k(p+1)$ = number of regression coefficients including the intercept.
 $k-1$ = number of proportions -1 (because their sum is 1).
 $(k-1)(1-1/restrfact(1))+1$ = constraints on the $\sigma^2_j$.
 To the above parameters, if $alphaX=1$ we must add:
 $k(p-1)p/2$ = rotation parameters for $\Sigma_X=cov(X)$.
 $(kp-1)(1-1/restrfactor(2))+1$ = eigenvalue parameters for
 $\Sigma_X=cov(X)$.
