To understand the
   characteristics the .m file must have, please see the "More About" section</P><h2>More About</h2><P>
         The .m file (which must be located on the MATLAB path or on the current
         folder) must satisfy the following characteristics to be correctly
         processed.

         [1] The row below the row which starts with 'function ....' must contain the
         description of the purpose of the .m file.
         Remark: generally the row which starts with 'function ....' is the first
         row of an .m file.
         [2] String 'Required input arguments:' must be present. The lines below
         this string must contain the description of the compulsory input
         arguments. Each argument must have the name (a series of spaces from 0
         to 10) symbol ':' and then the description. The format of the description
         is as follows:
         The first sentence after symbol ':' is the title of the input argument
         and in the HTML file it will appear in bold face in the same line of the
         input argument (this is the short description of the required input
         argument).
         The second sentence after symbol ':' describes the objects
         (for example, scalar, vector, 3D array) and in the HTML file will appear
         in the second row.
         These first two rows will always be visible.
         What starts with the third sentence after symbol ':' is the detailed
         description of that particular input argument and in the HTML file it
         will be visible just if the user clicks on any point in the first two
         lines or the user clicks on the option expand all.
         The last line may start with the words "Data Types -" and
         contains the specification of a particular input argument
         (e.g. Data Types - single | double). For example, suppose that the .m
         routine which has to be processed has two required input
         arguments which are respectively called y and X, then the
         accepted format is as follows.

                       Required input arguments:

                        y:         Response variable. Vector. Response variable,
                                   specified as a vector of length n, where n is
                                   the number of observations. Each entry in y is
                                   the response for the corresponding row of X.
                                   Data Types - single | double.
                      X :          Predictor variables. Matrix of explanatory
                                   variables (also called 'regressors') of
                                   dimension n x (p-1) where p denotes the number
                                   of explanatory variables including the
                                   intercept. Rows of X represent observations,
                                   and columns represent variables. By default,
                                   there is a constant term in the model, unless
                                   you explicitly remove it using input option
                                   intercept, so do not include a column of 1s in
                                   X.
                                   Data Types - single | double.

         IMPORTANT NOTICE: if an input argument is a structure (publishFS
         automatically checks if the input argument contains the word "structure"
         then the fields of the structure will be automatically included into a
         HTML table). In this case the fields of the structure are identified as
         the lines which contain "a series of spaces" "a_word" "a series
         of spaces followed by symbol '='". For example suppose the an input
         option is called bayes and object bayes is a structure with field names
         beta0, R, tau0 and n0, the accepted format is as follows.

            bayes      : prior information. Structure.
                               It contains the following fields.
                   out.beta0=  p-times-1 vector containing prior mean of \beta.
                   out.R    =  p-times-p positive definite matrix which can be
                               interpreted as X0'X0 where X0 is a n0 x p matrix
                               coming from previous experiments (assuming that the
                               intercept is included in the model.
                     out.tau0 = scalar. Prior estimate of tau.
                     out.n0   = scalar. Sometimes it helps to think of the prior
                              information as coming from n0 previous experiments.



         [3] If the input .m file between the row which starts with
          &lt;a href="matlab: docsearchFS(.....
          and the row with the string
          "Required input arguments:"
          contains a series of sentences, they will be automatically included in
          the HTML output just below the description.

          An example is given below:
                 'function [out , varargout]  = tclust(Y,k,alpha,restrfactor,varargin);
                 tclust computes trimmed clustering with restricitons on
                 the eigenvalues.

                 &lt;a href="matlab: docsearchFS('tclust')"&gt;Link to the help function&lt;/a&gt;;

                   tclust partitions the points in the n-by-v data matrix Y into k
                   clusters.  This partition minimizes the trimmed sum, over all
                   clusters, of the within-cluster sums of
                   point-to-cluster-centroid distances....

                  Required input arguments:'.

         [4] String 'Optional input arguments:' must be present even if there are
         no optional arguments.
         publishFS, in order to understand what are the names of the optional
         input arguments scans the rows below the string "Optional input
         arguments:" and identifies the lines which contain the optional arguments
         as those which contain "a series of spaces" "a_word" "a series of spaces
         followed by symbol ':'".
         The first sentence after symbol ':' is the title of the optional input
         argument and in the HTML file it will appear in the same row of the name
         of the optional input argument (this is the short description of the
         optional input argument).
         The second sentence after symbol ':' describes the objects (for example,
         scalar, vector, 3D array) and in the HTML file will appear in the second
         row. These first two rows will always be visible.
         What starts with the third sentence after symbol ':' is the detailed
         description of that particular optional input argument and in the HTML
         file it will be visible just if the user clicks on any point in the first
         two lines or the user clicks on the option expand all.
         The last two lines of each optional input argument MUST start with the
         words 'Example -' and 'Data Types -' followed by a string without spaces
         which specifies a possible use of the option and the type of data. For
         example, suppose that the first two optional arguments are called
         respecively 'intercept' and 'h', then the
         accepted format is as follows:


                       Optional input arguments:

                       intercept :  Indicator for constant term. Scalar.
                                   If 1, a model with constant term will be fitted
                                   (default), else no constant term will be included.
                                   Example - 'intercept',1.
                                   Data Types - double.
                               h : The number of observations that have determined the least
                                     trimmed squares estimator. Scalar.
                                     Example - 'h',round(n*0,75).
                                     Data Types - double.




          IMPORTANT NOTICE: given that options are identified as those which have
          symbol "%" followed by "a series of spaces" then "a word" then "a series
          of spaces" then symbol ":", each line inside the description does not
          have to start as follows "%   ANYWORD   :" because the parser will
          wrongly identify "ANYWORD" as an additional optional input argument. The
          only once exception to this rule is the word "%  REMARK :". However, if
          there is a remark, it must be put at the very end of the description of
          the optional input argument. At the very end means after the rows
           Example and Data Types.

         [5] String 'Output:' must be present.
         The lines after string 'Output:'
         must contain the list of the output arguments using the same rules
         described above for the optional arguments. In this case, however, the
         identification of the ouptut arguments is easier because they are
         extracted directly from the first line of the file (e.g. if the first
         line is as follows
         function [mdr,Un,BB,Bols,S2] = FSRmdr(y,X,bsb,varargin) then the 5
         output arguments are immediately known to the parser).
         In the case of output argument publishFS checks if the first 50
         characters contain the words "which contains" or "containing" e.g.:

                      mdr:         n -init x 2
                                   matrix containing the
                                   monitoring of minimum deletion residual.
                                   1st col = fwd search
                                   ........
                        Un:        (n-init) x 11 Matrix
                                   which contains the unit(s) included in the
                                   subset at each step of the search.
                                   ...........

         In this case what is after the strings "which contains" or "containing"
         will appear in bold face as the title of the output argument. What is
         before the strings "which contains" or "containing" will appear in the
         second row.

         For example, the above lines will be processed as follows:

              mdr   -  Monitoring of minimum deletion residual;
              n -init x 2 matrix.

              Un    - unit(s) included in the subset at each step of the search.
              (n-init) x 11 Matrix which contains the unit(s) included in the
              subset at each step of the search.

         If in the HTML file the user clicks on them the expdanded description
         (that is what starts after the second full stop will appear).

         Alternatively, if the first 50 characters of each output argument do not
         contain the strings "which contains" or "containing" the following
         convention is used. The first sentence after symbol ":" is assumed
         to be the title of the output argument and in the HTML file it will
         appear in bold face in the same line of the name of output
         argument. The second sentence (words between first and second full stop)
         will appear in the second row. The third sentence is the full description
         of the output argument. For example, suppose that the output of a
         procedure contains the objects mdr and Un, the accepted format
         is as follows.
               Output:

                      mdr:         Minimum deletion residual. Matrix.  n -init x 2
                                   matrix which contains the
                                   monitoring of minimum deletion residual.
                                   1st col = ...
                      Un:          Units included. Matrix. (n-init) x 11 Matrix
                                   which contains the unit(s) included in the
                                   subset at each step of the search.
                                   REMARK: in every step ....

         The above lines will be processed as follows:

              mdr   -  Minimum deletion residual. Matrix.
                       n -init x 2 matrix which contains the
                       monitoring of minimum deletion residual.
                       1st col = ...

              Un    - Units included. Matrix.
                       (n-init) x 11 Matrix which contains the unit(s)
                       included in the subset at each step of the search.
                       REMARK: in every step ....

         If in the HTML file the user clicks on them the expdanded description
         (that is what starts after the second full stop will appear).

         IMPORTANT NOTICE: Similarly to what happened for each input argument, if
         an output argument is a structure, publishFS automatically checks if it
         contains the words "structure" and "field". In this case, the fields of
         the structure will be automatically included into a HTML table. The
         fields of the structure are identified as the lines which contain "a
         series of spaces" "name_of_output_structure.a_word" "a series of spaces
         followed by symbol '='". For example suppose that the output of a
         procedure is an object called out which is a structure with two fields
         out.rew and out.beta, an accepted format is as follows:

                                    Output:

                                  out :     A structure containing the following fields:
                                            out.rew  = Scalar if out.rew=1 all
                                                       subsequent output refers to
                                                       reweighted else no
                                                       reweighting is done.
                                            out.beta = Vector of beta LTS (LMS)
                                                       coefficient estimates,
                                                       including the intercept
                                                       when options.intercept=1.
                                                       out.beta=[intercept
                                                       slopes].


         PLEASE REMEMBER THAT THE FIELDS of an output instance HAVE TO CONTAIN THE
         "=" SIGN AND NOT THE ":" SIGN.

         REMARK: If there is the string REMARK after the description of the last
         field of the structure, all the words after REMARK are put outside and
         below the HTML table.

         If the description of a particular output has the string "which contains"
         or "containing",  as follows

                      mdr:          n -init x 2 matrix which contains the
                                   monitoring of minimum deletion residual at each
                                   step of the forward search.
                                   1st col = fwd search index (from init to n-1).
                                   2nd col = minimum deletion residual.

         publishFS will try to put what comes before the string "which
         contains" or "containing" inside the subtitle (second row) of the each
         ouptut argument in the HTML file. For example, the example above in the
         HTML file will be processed as follows:
                        mdr -Monitoring of minimum deletion residual at each step of the forward search.
                        n -init -by- 2 matrix.
         If, in the HTML file, the user clicks on the first line:
                       "mdr -Monitoring...";
         the expanded description will automatically appear.

         [6] A line which starts with string "See also:" must be present.
         Linked m files must be separated by symbol ",". For example, suppose that
         files FSRBmdr.m and FSR.m have connections with the current file, then an
         accepted format is         See also: FSRBmdr.m, FSR.m.

         [7] A line which starts with string "References:" must be present.
         The year of each reference must be enclosed in round parenthesis.
         PublishFS decides that a new reference starts if a new line contains
         symbol "(" + "a sequence of 4 or 5 characthers identifying the year
         because the reference can be for example 2003 or 2003a" + symbol ")"
         For example, an acceptable format for the two references below is:

         [8] All the examples associated with the file which has to be processed
         must be enclosed inside Percent-braces (comments blocks, i.e.
         symbols "%{" and "%}" ).
         The first sentence identifies the title of the comment which
         will appear in the HTML file.
         IMPORTANT NOTICE: if the comment has to be executed, the first line
         associated with the title must start with two "%%" symbols instead of just
         one "%" symbol. The examples in the first positions will appear in
         the HTML file under the caption "Examples" while the latest will appear
         under the caption "Related Examples". More precisely, if the output of a
         procedure contains k outputs and some optional input arguments the first
         k+1 comment blocks will appear in the HTML file under "Examples".
         First comment block is associated with the call of the procedure with
         just one output and all default input arguments.
         Second comment block is associated with the call of the procedure with
         just one output and with some optional input arguments.
         Third comment block is associated with the call of the procedure with
         two output arguments.
         ...
         k+1 comment block is associated with the call of the procedure with
         k output arguments.
         k+2 comment block is the first which in the HTML file will appear under
         the heading "Related Examples".
         For example, suppose that the first example of procedure FSRmdr has to be
         executed and its output must be included into the HTML file, then the accepted
         format is as follows ("please notice the two symbols "%%" in the
         first row").


                         "%{".
                             "%% FSRmdr with all default options".
                             "% Compute minimum deletion residual".
                             "% Monitor minimum deletion residual in each step of the forward search".
                             "% Common part to all examples: load fishery dataset".
                              load('fishery');
                              y=fishery.data(:,2);
                              X=fishery.data(:,1);
                              "% Find starting subset"
                              [out]=LXS(y,X,'nsamp',10000);
                              [mdr] = FSRmdr(y,X,out.bs);
                              plot(mdr(:,1),mdr(:,2))
                              title('Monitoring of minimum deletion residual')
                         "%}".

                         "%{".
                             "% FSRmdr with optional arguments".
                             "% Choose step to start monitoring".
                             "% Compute minimum deletion residual and
                              start monitoring it from step 60".
                             [mdr] = FSRmdr(y,X,out.bs,'init',60).
                         "%}".

          In order to understand where the example finish and the MATLAB code
          starts publishFS checks if one of the following strings
         is present
         "Input parameters checking",
         "Beginning of code",
         "nargin".
         If this is the case the search of "comments blocks signs"
         (i.e. symbols  "%{" and "%}") is limited to the first character prior
         to the detection of one of the previous strings. This
         modification has been added in order to make sure that there are
         no additional block signs within matlab code.

         [9] If a procedure contains varargout, then the string:
                       "Optional Output:"
         must be present. For example suppose there is a function called mcd which
         has the following sintax:

                         function [RAW,REW,varargout] = mcd(Y,varargin).

         Then at the end of the output argument the format must be as follows:

                               Optional Output:

                                         C     : matrix of the indices of the
                                                 subsamples extracted for
                                                 computing the estimate.

         [10] If the .m file contains string  "More About:" a particular section
         called "More about" in the HTML file will be created
         (just before See Also).
         [11] If the .m file contains string "Acknowledgements:" then a particular
         section named "Acknowledgements" will be created just above the
         references.

         GENERAL REMARKS:

         -----------------------------------------------------------------------:.
         REMARK1: if symbol "%" is wanted and it is not a simple comment delimiter, it
         must be replaced by words "per cent". For example, string "50 envelope"
         must become "50 per cent" envelope.
         -----------------------------------------------------------------------:.
         REMARK2: If there is just one output argument it can be without square
         brackets. Among the input elements of a procedure the number of spaces
         between them is not important. For example
         "y,X,varargin" or "y, X   ,  varargin"   are both fine.
         -----------------------------------------------------------------------:.
         REMARK 3: publishFS uses javascript matlab-highlighter.min.js in order to
         automatically color the examples in the HTML file.
         -----------------------------------------------------------------------:.
         REMARK 4: publishFS uses MathJax javascript in order to interpret the
         equations inside the .m file written in Latex style. For in line
         equations both symbols dollar dollar  and backslash(  backslash) are accepted.
         For single line equations symbols backslash[ backslash] must be used.
         -----------------------------------------------------------------------:.
         REMARK 5: if there are not enough examples in the .m file the procedure
         still runs but a warning will be automatically produced.
         -----------------------------------------------------------------------:.
         REMARK 6: the output file to be correctly viewed must be located in a
         folder which contains a subfolder named includesFS containing the files
         present inside
         (home FSDA) filesep helpfiles filesep FSDA filesep includesFS.
         Therefore if the
         the directory which contains the output file is not located inside
         (home FSDA) filesep helpfiles filesep FSDA subfolder
         includesFS must be copied into the current folder.
         -----------------------------------------------------------------------:.
         REMARK 7: strings are HTML formatted as follows. Every time there is
         symbol ". one_or_more_space symbol_of carriage_return" or
         ": one_or_more_space symbol_of carriage_return" the parser adds HTML
         string '&lt;/p&gt;/&lt;p&gt;' after just symbol "."  or symbol ":".
         This is done using subfunction named formatHTML at the end of this file.
         subfunction formatHTMLwithMATHJAX is even more general because it applies
         function formatHTML just to the parts of the input string which are not
         enclosed inside symbols 'backslash[ backslash]'.
         -----------------------------------------------------------------------:.
         REMARK 8: parser automatically puts an hyperlink every time in the text
         there is something which starts with "http": or every time there is a
         reference to a .m file. For example the sentence: "More details can be
         found in routine ncx2mixtcdf.m" is converted as follows.
         "More details can be found in routine
         &lt;a href="ncx2mixtcdf.html"&gt;ncx2mixtcdf&lt;/a&gt;".
         Similarly, a sentence such as:
         The full paper can be downloaded from "http://www.mysite.org".
         is converted as follows:
         "The full paper can be donwloaded from
         &lt;a href="http://www.mysite.org"&gt; http://www.mysite.org &lt;/a&gt;".
