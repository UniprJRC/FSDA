 MCD computes the MCD estimator of a multivariate data set.  This
 estimator is given by the subset of h observations with smallest
 covariance determinant.  The MCD location estimate is then the mean of
 those h points, and the MCD scatter estimate is their covariance matrix.
 The default value of h is roughly 0.5n (where n is the total number of
 observations), but the user may choose each value between n/2 and n.

 The MCD method is intended for continuous Gaussian variables, and assumes
 that the number of observations n is at least 5 times the number of
 variables p. If p is too large relative to n, it is better to use options
 betathresh=1 (that is to use a threshold based on beta distribution (for
 the units which determine the centroid and the covariance matrix) and F
 distribution (for the units which are excluded from the computation of
 centroid and covariance matrix)

 The MCD method was introduced in:

   Rousseeuw, P.J. (1984), Least Median of Squares Regression,
   "Journal of the American Statistical Association", Vol. 79, pp. 871-881.

   The program below uses the technique of concentration steps described in

   Rousseeuw, P.J. and Van Driessen, K. (1999), "A Fast Algorithm for the
   Minimum Covariance Determinant Estimator," Technometrics, 41, pp. 212-223.

 The MCD is a robust method in the sense that the estimates are not unduly
 influenced by outliers in the data, even if there are many outliers.
 Due to the MCD's robustness, we can detect outliers by their large
 robust distances. The latter are defined like the usual Mahalanobis
 distance, but based on the MCD location estimate and scatter matrix
 (instead of the nonrobust sample mean and covariance matrix).


 Remark: when more than h observations lie on a (hyper)plane, (perfect fit
 case) the program still yields the MCD location and scatter matrix, the
 latter being singular (as it should be), as well as the equation of the
 hyperplane.
