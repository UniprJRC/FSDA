 distribution ('outcomes') and columns ('treatments') which is expecially
 suited for the analysis of large and sparse $I$-by-$J$ contingency
 tables. The procedure is based on the collapsing of the original table
 into a set of 2-by-2 tables for each cell of the original table which has
 no less than a small number of counts (set in the optional input
 parameter 'threshold') and testing each of the resulting collapsed tables
 for independence by any test (Fisher exact test (default), Barnard test
 or those belonging to the power divergence family of Cressie and Read).
 Because of the Bonferroni inequality, a sufficient condition for
 attaining a significance level $\alpha$ for this test (i.e., the
 probability of detecting a positive association between two levels of the
 response variables when in fact there is no such association) is that
 each test done for each cell of the $I$-by-$J$ table rejects with
 significance level equal to $\alpha$ divided by the number of comparisons
 done. An additional bonus of the procedures is that it enables to
 highlight the most important contribution to the association of each
 single entry of the original I-by-J-table two way table. The original
 idea of this test is due to Spyros Arsenis (Joint Research Centre of the
 European Commission) and has been successfully applied to the analysis of
 contingency table coming from international trade data.</P><h2>More About</h2><P>
  $N$ = $I$-by-$J$-contingency table. The $(i,j)$-th element is equal to
  $n_{ij}$,  $i=1, 2, \ldots, I$ and $j=1, 2, \ldots, J$. The sum of the
  elements of N is $n$ (the grand total). The sum of the elements of the
  $i$-th row of the contingency table is denoted with $n_{i.}$ (n_idot in
  the code). The sum of the elements of the $j$-th column of the
  contingency table is denoted with $n_{.j}$ (n_dotj in the code).
  $P$=$I$-by-$J$-table containing correspondence matrix
  (proportions). The $(i,j)$-th element is equal to
  $n_{ij}/n$, $i=1, 2, \ldots, I$ and $j=1, 2,
  \ldots, J$.  The sum of the elements of $P$ is 1.
  $P^*$=$I$-by-$J$-table containing correspondence matrix (proportions)
  under the hypothesis of independence. The $(i,j)$-th element is equal to
  $p_{ij}^*=p_{i.}p_{.j}$, $i=1, 2, \ldots, I$ and $j=1, 2, \ldots, J$.  
  The sum of the elements of $P^*$ is 1.
