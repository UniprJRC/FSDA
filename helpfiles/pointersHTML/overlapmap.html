 components. These components are ordered according to a specific rule:
 first the closest pair is plotted in the lowest left corner, then the
 components closer to the ones already included are plotted (when all of
 them have a zero overlap value with the ones already included, the
 closest pair between all the remaining ones is inserted). The overlap map
 can either shows with different colors the closeness between components
 (i.e. in a descriptive manner), or it becomes an interactive plot with a
 left click on the color bar, which find and visualize the closest
 components according to a specific threshold value $ \omega^* $ (i.e.
 omegaStar), which specifies the minimum paiwise overlap threshold value
 used to merge the components. The interactive process ends with a right
 click on the white grid in the upper left corner of the plot, it also
 updates the results creating in the workspace a new variable
 'userOverlap'. See the More About section for further informations.</P><h2>More About</h2><P>      
 In the code 'overM' represents a triangular matrix, denoted as $ \Omega $,
 which contains the pairwise overlap values. The merging phase starts
 searching the maximum pairwise overlap value in $ \Omega $, i.e. $ \max
 (\Omega_{k k'}) $, and then deletes this value (e.g. setting it to NaN).
 This new matrix obtained is denoted as $ \Omega' $. The respective rows and
 columns corresponding to the element deleted in $ \Omega' $ are placed in
 a new matrix $ \Omega'' $. The algorithm progressively continue the same
 process, searching the highest pairwise overlap value in the components
 closest to the ones previously found, i.e. in the respective rows or
 columns of the components $ k $ and $ k' $. When the latter are all
 zeros, the process starts again considering the remaining values in 
 $ \Omega $.
 
 The values $ \max(\Omega'_{k k'}) $ and the respective $ k $ and $ k' $
 labels are sequentially saved in a $ k(k-1)/2 \times 3 $ matrix MergMat.
