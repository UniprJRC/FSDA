 $\tau_b$, $\tau_c$ of Kendall and $d_{y|x}$ of Somers.
 All these indexes measure the correlation among two ordered qualitative
 variables and go between -1 and 1. The sign of the coefficient indicates
 the direction of the relationship, and its absolute value indicates the
 strength, with larger absolute values indicating stronger
 relationships. Values close to an absolute value of 1 indicate a strong
 relationship between the two variables. Values close to 0 indicate little
 or no relationship. More in detail:
 $\gamma$ is a symmetric measure of association.
 Kendall's $\tau_a$ is a symmetric measure of association that does not
 take ties into account. Ties happen when both members of the data pair
 have the same value.
 Kendall's $\tau_b$ is a symmetric measure of association which takes ties
 into account. Even if $\tau_b$ ranges from -1 to 1, a value of -1 or
 +1 can be obtained only from square tables.
 $\tau_c$ (also called Stuart-Kendall $\tau_c$) is a symmetric measure of
 association which makes an adjustment for table size in addition to a
 correction for ties. Even if $\tau_c$ ranges from -1 to 1, a value of -1
 or +1 can be obtained only from square tables.
 Somers' $d$ is an asymmetric extension of $\tau_b$ in that it uses a
 correction only for pairs that are tied on the independent variable
 (which in this implementation it is assumed to be on the rows of the
 contingency table).
 Additional details about these indexes can be found in the "More About"
 section of this document.</P><h2>More About</h2><P>

 All these indexes are based on concordant and discordant pairs.
 A pair of observations is concordant if the subject who is higher on one
 variable also is higher on the other variable, and a pair of observations
 is discordant if the subject who is higher on one variable is lower on
 the other variable.
 Let $C$ be the total number of concordant pairs (concordances) and $D$
 the total number of discordant pairs (discordances) . If $C &gt; D$ the
 variables have a positive association, but if $C &lt; D$ then the variables
 have a negative association.

 In symbols, given an $I \times J$ contingency table the concordant pairs
 with cell $i,j$ are
 \[
 a_{ij} = \sum_{k&lt;i} \sum_{l&lt;j} n_{kl} + \sum_{k&gt;i} \sum_{l&gt;j}   n_{kl}
 \]

 the number of discordant pairs is

 \[
 b_{ij} = \sum_{k&gt;i} \sum_{l&lt;j} n_{kl} + \sum_{k&lt;i} \sum_{l&gt;j} n_{kl}
 \]


 Twice the number of concordances, $C$ is given by:
 \[
 2 \times C = \sum_{i=1}^I \sum_{j=1}^J n_{ij} a_{ij}
 \]
 Twice the number of discordances, $D$ is given by:
 \[
 2 \times D = \sum_{i=1}^I \sum_{j=1}^J n_{ij} b_{ij}
 \]

 Goodman-Kruskal's $\gamma$ statistic is equal to the ratio:

 \[
 \gamma= \frac{C-D}{C+D}
 \]


 $\tau_a$ is equal to concordant minus discordant pairs, divided by a
 factor which takes into account the total number of pairs.

 \[
  \tau_a= \frac{C-D}{0.5 n(n-1)}
 \]

 $\tau_b$ is equal to concordant minus discordant
 pairs divided by a term representing the geometric mean between the
 number of pairs not tied on x and the number not tied on y.
 More precisely:
 \[
  \tau_b= \frac{C-D}{\sqrt{ (0.5 n(n-1)-T_x)(0.5 n(n-1)-T_y)}}
 \]
 where $T_x= \sum_{i=1}^I 0.5 n_{i.}(n_{i.}-1)$ and
 $T_y=\sum_{j=1}^J 0.5 n_{.j}(n_{.j}-1)$
 Note that $\tau_b \leq \gamma$.

 $\tau_c$ is equal to concordant minus discordant pairs multiplied by a factor that adjusts
 for table size.
 \[
  \tau_c= \frac{C-D}{ n^2(m-1)/(2m)}
 \]
 where $m= min(I,J)$;

 Somers' $d_{y|x}$ is an
 asymmetric extension of $\gamma$ that differs only in the inclusion of the
 number of pairs not tied on the independent variable. More precisely

 \[
  d_{y|x} = \frac{C-D}{0.5 n(n-1)-T_x}
 \]

 Null hypothesis:
 corresponding index = 0. Alternative hypothesis (one-sided) index &lt; 0 or
 index &gt; 0.



 In order to compute confidence intervals and test hypotheses, this
 routine computes the standard error of the various indexes.
 Note that the expression of the standard errors which is used to compute
 the confidence intervals is different from the expression which is used
 to test the null hypothesis of no association (no relationship or independence)
 between the two variables.

As concerns the Goodman-Kruskal's $\gamma$ index we have that:
 \[
  var(\gamma) =   \frac{4}{(C + D)^4}  \sum_{i=1}^I \sum_{j=1}^J
  n_{ij} (D a_{ij} - C b_{ij} )^2
 \]
 where
 \[
 d_{ij}=a_{ij}- b_{ij}
 \]

 The variance of $\gamma$  assuming the independence hypothesis is:
 \[
 var_0(\gamma) =\frac{1}{(C + D)^2} \left( \sum_{i=1}^I \sum_{j=1}^J
  n_{ij} d_{ij}^2  -4(C-D)^2/n  \right)
 \]

 As concerns $\tau_a$ we have that:
 \[
 var(\tau_a)= \frac{2}{n(n-1)} \left\{ \frac{2(n-2)}{n(n-1)^2}  \sum_{i=1}^I \sum_{j=1}^J (d_{ij} - \overline d)^2 + 1 - \tau_a^2 \right\}
 \qquad \mbox{with $i,j$ such that $N(i,j)&gt;0$}
 \]
 where

 \[
 \overline d = \sum_{i=1}^I \sum_{j=1}^J d_{ij} /n  \qquad \mbox{with $i,j$ such that $N(i,j)&gt;0$}
 \]

 The variance of $\tau_a$  assuming the independence hypothesis is:
 \[
 var_0(\tau_a) =\frac{2 (2n+5)}{9n(n-1) }
 \]


 As concerns $\tau_b$ we have that:
 \[
 var(\tau_b)= \frac{n}{w^4} \left\{ n \sum_{i=1}^I \sum_{j=1}^J n_{ij} \tau_{ij}^2 - \left( \sum_{i=1}^I \sum_{j=1}^J  n_{ij}\tau_{ij}\right)^2  \right\}
 \]
 where

 \[
  \tau_{ij} = 2n d_{ij} +2(C-D) n_{.j} w /n^3+2(C-D) (n_{i.}/n) \sqrt{
  w_c/w_r} \qquad \mbox{and} \qquad w= \sqrt{w_rw_c}
 \]

 The variance of $\tau_b$  assuming the independence hypothesis is:
 \[
 var_0(\tau_b) =\frac{4}{w_r w_c}  \left\{ \sum_{i=1}^I \sum_{j=1}^J n_{ij} d_{ij} ^2 -4(C-D)^2/n \right\}
 \]


 As concerns Stuart's $\tau_c$ we have that:
 \[
 var(\tau_c)= \frac{4m^2}{(m-1)^2 n^4} \left\{ \sum_{i=1}^I \sum_{j=1}^J n_{ij} d_{ij} ^2 -4(C-D)^2/n \right\}
 \]



 The variance of $\tau_c$  assuming the independence hypothesis is:
 \[
 var_0(\tau_c) =var(\tau_c)
 \]


 As concerns $d_{y|x}$ we have that:
 \[
 var( d_{y|x})= \frac{4}{w_r^4} \left\{ \sum_{i=1}^I \sum_{j=1}^J n_{ij}
 (w_r d_{ij} -2(C-D) (n-n_{i.}) \right\}^2
 \]
 where
 \[
 w_r= n^2- \sum_{i=1}^I n_{i.}^2
 \]

 The variance of $d_{y|x}$  assuming the independence hypothesis is:
 \[
 var_0(d_{y|x}) = \frac{4}{w_r^2} \left\{ \sum_{i=1}^I \sum_{j=1}^J n_{ij} d_{ij} ^2 -4(C-D)^2/n \right\}
 \]

 From the theoretical point of view, Simon (1978) showed that all sample
 measures having the same numerator $(C-D)$ have the same efficacy and hence
 the same local power, for testing independence.
