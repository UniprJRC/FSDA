    of the modifications which have been made.</P><h2>More About</h2><P>

 The supersmoother algorithm computes three separate smooth curves from
 the input data with symmetric spans of 0.05*n, 0.2*n and 0.5*n, where n
 is the number of data points.  The best of the three smooth curves is
 chosen for each predicted point using leave-one-out cross validation. The
 best spans are then smoothed by a fixed-span smoother (span = 0.2*n) and
 the prediction is computed by linearly interpolating between the three
 smooth curves.  This final smooth curve is then smmothed again with a
 fixed-span smoother (span = 0.05*n).

 According to comments by Friedman, "For small samples (n &lt; 40) or if
 there are substantial serial correlations between observations close in
 x-value, then a prespecified fixed span smoother (span &gt; 0) should be
 used.  Reasonable span values are 0.2 to 0.4."

    This function is basically equal to the 
   function supsmu written in MALTAB by Douglas M. Schwarz.

    The following modifications with respect to the original function have
    been made:
    [1] In case of constant values of x over a span program was producng
    NA. Modifications have been done in the subroutinesto cope with this
    case. 
    [2] The formula for the cross validation residuals in presence of
    constant values has been introduced.
    [3] All the Mlint suggestions have been incorporated. 
    [4] The help has been put inside the FSDA style.
    [5] A series of examples which explore the different options has been
    added.
