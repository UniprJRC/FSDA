 table $T=[n_{ij}]$ where $i=1, 2, ..., r$ and $j=1,...,c$ and $n_{ij}$
 denotes the number of data points which are in cluster i in the first
 partition and in cluster j in the second partition. Let A denote the
 number of all pairs of data points which are either put into the same
 cluster by both partitions or put into different clusters by both
 partitions. Conversely, let D denote the number of all pairs of data
 points that are put into one cluster in one partition, but into different
 clusters by the other partition. The partitions disagree for all pairs D
 and agree for all pairs A. A+D=totcomp= total number of comparisons.
 We can measure the agreement by the Rand index A/(A+D)=A/(totcomp) which
 is invariant with respect to permutations of the columns or rows of T.
 The index has to be corrected for agreement by chance if the sizes of the
 clusters are not uniform (which is usually the case). Since the Rand
 index lies between 0 and 1, the expected value of the Rand index
 (although not a constant value) must be greater than or equal to 0. On
 the other hand, the expected value of the adjusted Rand index has value
 zero and the maximum value of the adjusted Rand index is also 1. Hence,
 there is a wider range of values that the adjusted Rand index can take
 on, thus increasing the sensitivity of the index. The formula of the
 adjusted Rand index (AR) is given below
 \[
  AR= \frac{\mbox{RI- Expected value of RI}}{\mbox{Max Index  - Expected value of RI}}
