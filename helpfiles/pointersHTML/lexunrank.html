   REMARKS ON THE INPUT ARGUMENTS.

   Input checks are intentionally avoided, as lexunrank is supposed to be
   called many times, for sampling subsets. Thus, please ensure that:
   - k &lt; n;
   - N is an integer between 0 and bc(n,p)-1.
   It is possible to enable checks, by changing an internal "if" statement to 1.

   REMARKS ON THE OUTPUT ARGUMENTS.

   As $n$ increases, 'calls' becomes much smaller than 'ncomb'. This means
   that lexunrank(n,k,N) is extremely convenient if you are interested in
   one or several, but not all, $k$-combinations at given generation
   order(s) N.

   To generate all combinations in lexicographic order, it is more 
   convenient using the FSDA function combsFS. The MATLAB function
   with the same purpose, nchoosek(1:4,3), is much less efficient.

   ON THE LEXICOGRAPHIC ORDERING.

   lexunrank(n,k,N) gives the $k$-combination of n elements of position N
   in the reverse co-lexicographic order of such combinations or,
   equivalently, of position bc(n,k)-N in the lexicographic order of the
   same combinations.
   
   Note that, in this implementation of the lexicographic unrank, N ranges
   over the integers between 0 and bc(n,k)-1. For details see the
   "combinatorial number system" discussed by Knuth (2005), pp. 5-6.

   To clarify with an example the meaning of the different orders, while
   the lexicographic order of the 2-combinations of 3 elements are:
   
   \[ 
     \left( 
        \begin{array}{ccc}
           1  &   2  &   3     \\
           1  &   2  &   4     \\
           1  &   3  &   4     \\
           2  &   3  &   4 
        \end{array} 
      \right)
   \] 

   the co-lexicographic order of the same combinations are
   
   \[ 
     \left( 
        \begin{array}{ccc}
           3   &  2  &   1     \\
           4   &  2  &   1     \\
           4   &  3  &   1     \\
           4   &  3  &   2
        \end{array} 
      \right)
   \] 
   
   and the reverse co-lexicographic order of the original combinations are:

   \[ 
     \left( 
        \begin{array}{ccc}
           4   &  3  &   2     \\
           4   &  3  &   1     \\
           4   &  2  &   1     \\
           3   &  2  &   1     
        \end{array} 
      \right)
   \] 

   The reasons for choosing a co-lexicographic unrank is that right-to-left 
   array filling is much faster and elegant. The reverse is due to a similar 
   motivation.


   ALGORITMIC DETAILS.

 Given the totally ordered set $S=\{1,2,\ldots,n\}$, a $k$-combination is
 a subset $\{x_1, \ldots, x_k\}$ of $S$. Consider the $n$-lists of
 elements of the set $\{0,1\}$, i.e. the vertices of the hypercube $V_n$.
 Each $k$-combination $\{x_1,\ldots,x_k\}$ can be associated to the
 $n$-list having a 1 at position $x_1$, \ldots, $x_k$, and a 0 elsewhere.

 Example:
   2-combinations of $\{1,2,3,4\}$: $\{1,2\}$, $\{1,3\}$, $\{1,4\}$,
   $\{2,3\}$, $\{2,4\}$, $\{3,4\}$. Corresponding 4-lists of $\{0,1\}$:
   $1100$,  $1010$,  $1001$,  $0110$, $0101$,  $0011$.

 The $n$-lists of $\{0,1\}$ containing $k$ times 1, and therefore
 equivalently the $k$-combinations of $n$-elements of $S$, can be
 generated in lexicographic order with an algorithm that builds the
 $k$-list of position $t+1$ using only the $k$-list of position $t$, and
 which stops without counting the combinations generated. For example, the
 MATLAB function NCHOOSEK(S,k), where $S$ is the row vector of length $n$
 of the elements of $S$, creates in lexicographic order a $k$ columns
 matrix whose rows consist of all possible combinations of the $n$
 elements of $S$ taken $k$ at a time. The number of such combinations,
 given by the binomial coefficient $n!/((n-k)! k!)$, can be also computed
 with the function NCHOOSEK by replacing the first argument, the row
 vector $S$, with the scalar $n$.

 Unfortunately the binomial coefficient increases rapidly with $n$, which
 makes the generation of all $k$-combinations computationally hard: with
 NCHOOSEK the task is impractical even for values just above 15. However,
 a lexicographic algorithm implements a one-to-one correspondence between
 the $k$-combinations and the generation order, i.e. the set of numbers $s
 = 1,\ldots,(n!/((n-k)!k!))$. This fact is used in our function to
 determine the $n$-list corresponding to the $k$-combination $\{x_1,
 \ldots, x_k\}$ which would be generated by the lexicographic algorithm at
 a given desired position $N$. This is useful in a number of applications
 which require one or several, but not all, $k$-combinations at given
 generation order(s).
